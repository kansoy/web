## Research Background

The rapid growth of sustainable investing—now exceeding $35 trillion globally—has transformed financial markets, yet the implications for monetary policy transmission remain unexplored. This research uncovers how ESG characteristics create distinct transmission mechanisms through heterogeneous investor preferences and long-term investment horizons.

## Methodology

Using high-frequency identification around 160 Federal Reserve announcements (2005-2025), we develop a comprehensive understanding of ESG-monetary policy interactions, supported by a theoretical two-period model featuring heterogeneous investors with sustainability preferences.
