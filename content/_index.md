It's <strong>Fatih</strong>. I currently hold a position as an Assistant Professor (Teaching) in Economics at the [University of Warwick](https://www.warwick.ac.uk). I completed my  Ph.D. in Economics from the <strong> [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics)  </strong>. My research primarily focuses on quantitative [with hig-frequency financial data] finance, computational economcs history (digital history), and, more specifically, the intricate world of <strong> [central banking](https://www.centralbanking.ai) </strong>.

Since 2019, I have been actively involved in teaching a diverse array of macro-finance courses. Additionally, I have been guiding both undergraduate and postgraduate students through their dissertation journeys, particularly in areas related to empirical finance and macroeconomics. This teaching and supervisory role spans across multiple platforms including the <strong>[Department of Economics](https://warwick.ac.uk/economics)</strong>, <strong>  [Warwick Business School](https://wbs.ac.uk)</strong>, and the <strong>[Warwick Summer School](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/summer-with-warwick/warwick-summer-school/courses/banking)</strong> at the University of Warwick.
