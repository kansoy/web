On this Research page, you'll find my research interests: central bank communication, empirical finance, applied economics, and the economics of artificial intelligence. My focus lies in blending quantitative finance with machine learning to understand historical and contemporary economic phenomena. Central to my work is a detailed study of central bank communication, where I seek to uncover insights using high-frequency data and computational methods.
