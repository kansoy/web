## Organisation

The course will be divided into two parts. The first part of the course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use mathematical tools and theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. The second part of the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy and global banking. We will analyze theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analyzing policy responses.

### Approach:

The course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. Furthermore, the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy. We will analyse various theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analysing policy responses.

### Prerequisites

- An undergraduate-level understanding of economics/finance knowledge is assumed.
- Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is required.

### Class Policy

- Regular attendance is essential and expected.

### Grading Policy:

- The module is examined in a two and half hour written exam in May (80%) and one 1-hour end-of-term test (20%).
- The end-of-term test will be held on March 18th (Check the date and time again).
- End of term test will cover all topics covered in lectures from week 16 to 22.
- All topics covered up to week 24 (including) will be included in the final exam in May.

## Course Outline

### Principal Aims:

The aim of the module is to equip students with a variety of theoretical and econometric tools and knowledge to study and understand key issues in global finance and to analyse policy responses. It departs from standard theoretical models of international finance and uses mathematical tools and econometric methods to build up from these models and to assess complex issues relating to the global finance. The first objective is to introduce a set of issues and questions that are central to modern finance and macroeconomics, and that are genuinely interesting, such as: To provide students with the opportunity to understand the core theoretical models used in international macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, and how to use them to enhance their comprehension of real-world macroeconomic experiences, especially involving macroeconomic and financial policy.

### Principal Learning Outcomes:

By the end of the module, the student should have the theoretical and empirical tools and knowledge to understand current academic and policy debates in international finance. In addition, it is expected that the student will have an understanding of a wide variety of theoretical models commonly used in global finance; an ability to present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams as appropriate; an understanding of the relationship between different models, and how to apply them in the analysis of recent global finance episodes and policy discussions affecting actual economies and business world.

### Intellectual and Practical Skills:

- The ability to analyse facts and circumstances to determine the cause of a problem and identifying and selecting appropriate solutions.
- Conceptual and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
- Numeracy and quantitative skills to manipulate data, evaluate, estimate, and model business problems, functions, and phenomena.

## Required Readings:

There is no textbook for this course. The required readings consist of a collection of book chapters, journal articles, and working papers. Note that these readings may be subject to change. I will post the required readings before each class on the course website. The reading list includes many non-required readings. These are intended for those students that would like to deepen their understanding of a topic, particularly those that may be interested in working on the topic for their dissertation.

### Main References

The course is based on lecture notes/slides which will be posted in course page prior to the lectures. Participation in lectures together with studying the lecture notes, is sufficient to succeed on the course. The lecturer will make available all the slides used in lectures. There is no additional compulsory reading but here is the list of various interesting and useful books that will be touched during the course. In addition to book a number of journal articles are assigned readings and will be made available through the course website. Most of these articles are accessible introductions to a topic.
