Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too.\nApart from macroprudential tool central banks has another powerful tool: communication. Communication has become as important financial monitoring and management to effective central bank operations. If done well, communication can strengthen understanding of central bank objectives by market agent as well as public, help shape the market mood and provide reassurance in times of stress.\nIn this project, we are going to check and rank the communication channel and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective communication can help to shape the view of public and increase the policy effectiveness. In this regard, for example, the Guardian newspaper has recently changed their language on climate matters, and they no longer use \u0026ldquo;climate change\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;climate crisis” since it is a crisis, not a change. In a similar manner, by using natural language processing method, we are going to rank the central bank according to their sensitivity of this issue.\nBrief Description of Work # Collection of texts from central bank publications globally. Data cleaning and processing for dataset preparation. Analysis of complex datasets with reporting software and Python. Data collection and cleaning responsibilities. Interpretation and analysis for clear data visualizations. Experience with NLP tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch is advantageous.

The first part of the course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use mathematical tools and theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. The second part of the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy and global banking. We will analyze theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analyzing policy responses.\nApproach: #The course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. Furthermore, the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy. We will analyse various theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analysing policy responses.\nPrerequisites # An undergraduate-level understanding of economics/finance knowledge is assumed. Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is required. Class Policy # Regular attendance is essential and expected. Grading Policy: # The module is examined in a two and half hour written exam in May (80%) and one 1-hour end-of-term test (20%). The end-of-term test will be held on March 18th (Check the date and time again). End of term test will cover all topics covered in lectures from week 16 to 22. All topics covered up to week 24 (including) will be included in the final exam in May. Course Outline #Principal Aims: #The aim of the module is to equip students with a variety of theoretical and econometric tools and knowledge to study and understand key issues in global finance and to analyse policy responses. It departs from standard theoretical models of international finance and uses mathematical tools and econometric methods to build up from these models and to assess complex issues relating to the global finance. The first objective is to introduce a set of issues and questions that are central to modern finance and macroeconomics, and that are genuinely interesting, such as: To provide students with the opportunity to understand the core theoretical models used in international macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, and how to use them to enhance their comprehension of real-world macroeconomic experiences, especially involving macroeconomic and financial policy.\nPrincipal Learning Outcomes: #By the end of the module, the student should have the theoretical and empirical tools and knowledge to understand current academic and policy debates in international finance. In addition, it is expected that the student will have an understanding of a wide variety of theoretical models commonly used in global finance; an ability to present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams as appropriate; an understanding of the relationship between different models, and how to apply them in the analysis of recent global finance episodes and policy discussions affecting actual economies and business world.\nIntellectual and Practical Skills: # The ability to analyse facts and circumstances to determine the cause of a problem and identifying and selecting appropriate solutions. Conceptual and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Numeracy and quantitative skills to manipulate data, evaluate, estimate, and model business problems, functions, and phenomena. Required Readings: #There is no textbook for this course. The required readings consist of a collection of book chapters, journal articles, and working papers. Note that these readings may be subject to change. I will post the required readings before each class on the course website. The reading list includes many non-required readings. These are intended for those students that would like to deepen their understanding of a topic, particularly those that may be interested in working on the topic for their dissertation.\nMain References #The course is based on lecture notes/slides which will be posted in course page prior to the lectures. Participation in lectures together with studying the lecture notes, is sufficient to succeed on the course. The lecturer will make available all the slides used in lectures.

Focusing on the financial system and monetary policy, this course looks at key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, banking, monetary policy and importantly their interaction and how this impacts the real world. The course will relate this to recent economic events which have reverberated worldwide. It is particularly suitable for students wishing to enter careers in financial markets or further study in this area.\nThe Money and Banking course will look at some key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, monetary policy and banking and how their interactions affect the real world.\nThe financial system has undergone many changes since the credit crunch and the Central Banks have had the unenviable task of stimulating the economy, encouraging lending, managing inflation and exchange rates. This course will focus on the financial system and monetary policy in countries around the world and present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations, evaluating their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis.\nCourse Outline #The focus of the course will be the theory and practice of monetary policy institutions. Within this, the interaction between the financial system (in terms of its institutions and instruments) and the macroeconomy will be examined and there will be a strong practical and policy related element to the course. The course will present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations and evaluate their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis. A broad range of topics will be analysed, including how bank runs develop and a discussion of the financial crises in the US and the Eurozone and their different experiences. The course will also introduce the students to some of the state of the art methods applied in modern macroeconomics such as the new Keynesian models. The following list includes the topics that will be covered:\nMoney supply and the role of the banking sector Interest rates and rates of return The stock market and financial market efficiency Monetary policy and monetary rules New Keynesian macroeconomic models Financial crises and regulation The 2008’s financial crisis and monetary policy responses Course Aims #This course aims to draw on recent financial events from across the world and provide students with a detailed understanding of the economic theory behind the way in which monetary policy can be designed and implemented. By focussing on the interactions between monetary policy, banking and financial markets, this course will give students the tools they need to understand and evaluate these links and apply their findings to real world applications in a variety of countries. Students taking this course will gain a greater awareness of the key elements of the financial system and the roles played by different financial assets. The course aims to give students greater awareness of the monetary transmission mechanism and how we can use modern empirical methods to understand it.\nThere are important economic lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis and this course will aim to relate relevant economic theory and applications to recent events which have reverberated worldwide. With the aim of developing students’ knowledge and understanding of the complex interactions between monetary policy, financial markets, banks and the economic situation, this course will be ideal for anyone looking to further their knowledge in monetary and financial economics, perhaps with an aim of pursuing a career in this field or undertaking postgraduate study. It will therefore aim to provide students with a rare opportunity to combine academic theory with their interest in a future career in such a direct manner.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this module, students should be able to:\nUnderstand the main elements of the financial system. Apply both micro and macro theory to real-world situations in the areas of money and banking. Outline and give a detailed justification of the main goals of monetary policy. Assess the relative merits of different countries’ monetary policy institutions. Critically discuss and debate a range of current monetary issues. Express their views about pertinent monetary and fiscal issues and evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams. Course Structure #For this course, there will be 4 hours of teaching on most weekdays, comprised of lectures and small group teaching. The structure will be:\n3 hours of lectures. A 1 hour seminar in small groups. Students will also be given time each day for independent study. Towards the end of the third week, students will also be provided with time for revision.\nDue to the intensive nature of the Warwick Summer School, students are expected to attend all timetabled teaching activity, to engage with the teaching material and to spend an average of 2-3 hours per day in self-guided study.\nStudents registered for Warwick Summer School must attain a minimum of 75% authorised attendance of the timetabled teaching activity. If students fall short of this threshold, they will not be awarded a certificate of completion and they will not be able to sit the exam/submit final assessment.\nAuthorised attendance includes any sickness absence during the course of the programme that has been properly notified and recorded. An attendance register will be taken at the beginning of teaching session so students need to ensure they arrive on time in order to be marked as attended.\nCourse Assessment The module will be assessed via a 2-hour examination. It should be noted that the exam is not compulsory. Everyone who completes the course – whether or not they sit the exam - will receive a certificate of attendance.\nStudents who choose to sit the final exam will receive a transcript of results. The transcript of results will state the name of the student, the course studied, the exam mark and the grade. Transcripts are automatically sent to students via email by the middle of September. You should keep this safe in case you need it for credit transfer approval or for future reference. If you would like us to email a copy of your transcript directly to someone at your University who deals with credit transfer please let us know.\nThe Summer School does not offer re-takes of examinations, whatever your result in the original examination.\nEntry Requirements #This course is open to students who are studying or have previously studied Economics at University level.

This course covers three significant areas: the evolving landscape of digital currencies like Bitcoin and their potential to redefine traditional monetary systems; the vital role of central banks in addressing the global climate crisis and maintaining financial stability; and the impact of big financial data, AI, machine learning, and algorithmic trading on financial markets. Each topic is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of current and emerging trends in finance and economics, equipping them with insights into the challenges and opportunities in today\u0026rsquo;s interconnected financial world.\nBitcoin, cryptocurrency, central bank digital currency: Will Bitcoin become the money of the future? #In each single day, people around the world make more than 2 billion digital payments. Each of these transactions rely on the monetary system – the set of institutions and arrangements that surround and support monetary exchange. In other words a centralised system. This centralised system with the central bank at its centre has served society well. Yet digital innovation is expanding the frontier of technological possibilities, placing new demands on the system. Many believe that Bitcoin will replace the dollar and will be the money of the future. We will try to answer this question by considering other cryptocurrency and financial technology by comparison todays financial markets.\nGlobal Climate Crises and Financial Stability #The era of one policy objective –inflation targeting– and one tool – interest rates – is over for the central banks for the sake of financial stability. Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too. In this theme, we are going to understand the channels and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective monetary policy (green central banking) can help to shape the works of financial market and increase the policy effectiveness.\nBig Financial Data, AI, Machine Learning and Algorithm Trade. #Big financial data refers to large, diverse and complex data sets that has a potential to provide solutions to long-standing business challenges. In other words, big data is completely revolutionising in many different areas for the financial world. In this course we are going to look at how financial institutions can use real time big data to improve the ability for dealing with fraudulent activities, or how the functioning of financial markets will be changed. For example, trade pattern in stock exchanges all around world are going to be affected by algorithm trade by utilising high frequency data.\n","date":"10 August 2023","permalink":"/blog/finance21/","section":"Blog|News","summary":"I teach an engaging summer school course at the University of Warwick, specifically tailored for about 200 pre-university students from across the world.

Teaching Philosophy #My teaching philosophy is deeply inspired by Richard Feynman (illustrated above), a renowned physicist known not just for his groundbreaking research but also for his exceptional teaching skills. Feynman\u0026rsquo;s ability to unravel complex scientific concepts into understandable, engaging narratives profoundly resonated with me. His passionate and straightforward approach in explaining intricate theories set a high standard for educational excellence. He embodied the essence of making learning enjoyable and accessible, an ethos I strive to emulate in my own teaching. His unique method of fostering curiosity and critical thinking among students, often referred to as the Feynman Technique has been a guiding principle in my journey as an educator. In every course I teach, I aim to channel his enthusiasm for discovery and clarity, ensuring that my students not only grasp the theoretical aspects of Finance and Economics but also appreciate their practical applications in the real world.\nCourses #Courses for Masters # Topics in Global Finance (EC916) - Department of Economics - Module Leader\nMacroeconomics (EC956) - Warwick Business School - Module Leader\nEconomic Analysis (EC9DA) - Department of Economics - Lead Tutor\nCourses for Undergraduate # Quantitative Economics (EC106) - Dept of Math. - Module|Section Leader\nMacroeconomics 2 (EC201) - Dept of Economics - Lead Tutor\nFinancial Economics (EC333) - Department of Economics - Tutor\nResearch in Applied Economics (EC331) - Dept. of Economics - Supervisor\nCourses for Summer School # Money, Banking and Finance - Module Leader\nFinance in the 21st Century (Including Cryptocurrencies) - Module Leader\nDissertation Supervision # Textual Analysis (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing)\nQuantitative Finance (Asset Pricing, Financial Economics)\nMacroeconomics (Central Banking, Monetary Economics, International Macroeconomics)\n","date":"16 August 2020","permalink":"/teaching/","section":"fatih.ai","summary":"Learn how to get up and running using Hugo and Congo from a completely blank state.

It is particularly suitable for students wishing to enter careers in financial markets or further study in this area.\nThe Money and Banking course will look at some key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, monetary policy and banking and how their interactions affect the real world.\nThe financial system has undergone many changes since the credit crunch and the Central Banks have had the unenviable task of stimulating the economy, encouraging lending, managing inflation and exchange rates. This course will focus on the financial system and monetary policy in countries around the world and present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations, evaluating their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis.\nCourse Outline #The focus of the course will be the theory and practice of monetary policy institutions. Within this, the interaction between the financial system (in terms of its institutions and instruments) and the macroeconomy will be examined and there will be a strong practical and policy related element to the course. The course will present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations and evaluate their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis. A broad range of topics will be analysed, including how bank runs develop and a discussion of the financial crises in the US and the Eurozone and their different experiences. The course will also introduce the students to some of the state of the art methods applied in modern macroeconomics such as the new Keynesian models. The following list includes the topics that will be covered:\nMoney supply and the role of the banking sector Interest rates and rates of return The stock market and financial market efficiency Monetary policy and monetary rules New Keynesian macroeconomic models Financial crises and regulation The 2008’s financial crisis and monetary policy responses Course Aims #This course aims to draw on recent financial events from across the world and provide students with a detailed understanding of the economic theory behind the way in which monetary policy can be designed and implemented. By focussing on the interactions between monetary policy, banking and financial markets, this course will give students the tools they need to understand and evaluate these links and apply their findings to real world applications in a variety of countries. Students taking this course will gain a greater awareness of the key elements of the financial system and the roles played by different financial assets. The course aims to give students greater awareness of the monetary transmission mechanism and how we can use modern empirical methods to understand it.\nThere are important economic lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis and this course will aim to relate relevant economic theory and applications to recent events which have reverberated worldwide. With the aim of developing students’ knowledge and understanding of the complex interactions between monetary policy, financial markets, banks and the economic situation, this course will be ideal for anyone looking to further their knowledge in monetary and financial economics, perhaps with an aim of pursuing a career in this field or undertaking postgraduate study. It will therefore aim to provide students with a rare opportunity to combine academic theory with their interest in a future career in such a direct manner.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this module, students should be able to:\nUnderstand the main elements of the financial system. Apply both micro and macro theory to real-world situations in the areas of money and banking. Outline and give a detailed justification of the main goals of monetary policy. Assess the relative merits of different countries’ monetary policy institutions. Critically discuss and debate a range of current monetary issues. Express their views about pertinent monetary and fiscal issues and evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams. Course Structure #For this course, there will be 4 hours of teaching on most weekdays, comprised of lectures and small group teaching. The structure will be:\n3 hours of lectures. A 1 hour seminar in small groups. Students will also be given time each day for independent study. Towards the end of the third week, students will also be provided with time for revision.\nDue to the intensive nature of the Warwick Summer School, students are expected to attend all timetabled teaching activity, to engage with the teaching material and to spend an average of 2-3 hours per day in self-guided study.\nStudents registered for Warwick Summer School must attain a minimum of 75% authorised attendance of the timetabled teaching activity. If students fall short of this threshold, they will not be awarded a certificate of completion and they will not be able to sit the exam/submit final assessment.\nAuthorised attendance includes any sickness absence during the course of the programme that has been properly notified and recorded. An attendance register will be taken at the beginning of teaching session so students need to ensure they arrive on time in order to be marked as attended.\nCourse Assessment The module will be assessed via a 2-hour examination. It should be noted that the exam is not compulsory. Everyone who completes the course – whether or not they sit the exam - will receive a certificate of attendance.\nStudents who choose to sit the final exam will receive a transcript of results. The transcript of results will state the name of the student, the course studied, the exam mark and the grade. Transcripts are automatically sent to students via email by the middle of September. You should keep this safe in case you need it for credit transfer approval or for future reference. If you would like us to email a copy of your transcript directly to someone at your University who deals with credit transfer please let us know.\nThe Summer School does not offer re-takes of examinations, whatever your result in the original examination.\nEntry Requirements #This course is open to students who are studying or have previously studied Economics at University level. You should attach your most recent transcript or provide a screenshot of your modules from your student portal as evidence when you apply.

[Click to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OazQ0H7FAUk) Organisation #The course will be divided into two parts. The first part of the course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use mathematical tools and theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. The second part of the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy and global banking. We will analyze theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analyzing policy responses.\nApproach: #The course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. Furthermore, the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy. We will analyse various theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analysing policy responses.\nPrerequisites # An undergraduate-level understanding of economics/finance knowledge is assumed. Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is required. Class Policy # Regular attendance is essential and expected. Grading Policy: # The module is examined in a two and half hour written exam in May (80%) and one 1-hour end-of-term test (20%). The end-of-term test will be held on March 18th (Check the date and time again). End of term test will cover all topics covered in lectures from week 16 to 22. All topics covered up to week 24 (including) will be included in the final exam in May. Course Outline #Principal Aims: #The aim of the module is to equip students with a variety of theoretical and econometric tools and knowledge to study and understand key issues in global finance and to analyse policy responses. It departs from standard theoretical models of international finance and uses mathematical tools and econometric methods to build up from these models and to assess complex issues relating to the global finance. The first objective is to introduce a set of issues and questions that are central to modern finance and macroeconomics, and that are genuinely interesting, such as: To provide students with the opportunity to understand the core theoretical models used in international macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, and how to use them to enhance their comprehension of real-world macroeconomic experiences, especially involving macroeconomic and financial policy.\nPrincipal Learning Outcomes: #By the end of the module, the student should have the theoretical and empirical tools and knowledge to understand current academic and policy debates in international finance. In addition, it is expected that the student will have an understanding of a wide variety of theoretical models commonly used in global finance; an ability to present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams as appropriate; an understanding of the relationship between different models, and how to apply them in the analysis of recent global finance episodes and policy discussions affecting actual economies and business world.\nIntellectual and Practical Skills: # The ability to analyse facts and circumstances to determine the cause of a problem and identifying and selecting appropriate solutions. Conceptual and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Numeracy and quantitative skills to manipulate data, evaluate, estimate, and model business problems, functions, and phenomena. Required Readings: #There is no textbook for this course. The required readings consist of a collection of book chapters, journal articles, and working papers. Note that these readings may be subject to change. I will post the required readings before each class on the course website. The reading list includes many non-required readings. These are intended for those students that would like to deepen their understanding of a topic, particularly those that may be interested in working on the topic for their dissertation.\nMain References #The course is based on lecture notes/slides which will be posted in course page prior to the lectures. Participation in lectures together with studying the lecture notes, is sufficient to succeed on the course. The lecturer will make available all the slides used in lectures. There is no additional compulsory reading but here is the list of various interesting and useful books that will be touched during the course.
