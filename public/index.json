The first part of the course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use mathematical tools and theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. The second part of the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy and global banking. We will analyze theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analyzing policy responses.\nApproach: #The course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. Furthermore, the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy. We will analyse various theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analysing policy responses.\nPrerequisites # An undergraduate-level understanding of economics/finance knowledge is assumed. Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is required. Class Policy # Regular attendance is essential and expected. Grading Policy: # The module is examined in a two and half hour written exam in May (80%) and one 1-hour end-of-term test (20%). The end-of-term test will be held on March 18th (Check the date and time again). End of term test will cover all topics covered in lectures from week 16 to 22. All topics covered up to week 24 (including) will be included in the final exam in May. Course Outline #Principal Aims: #The aim of the module is to equip students with a variety of theoretical and econometric tools and knowledge to study and understand key issues in global finance and to analyse policy responses. It departs from standard theoretical models of international finance and uses mathematical tools and econometric methods to build up from these models and to assess complex issues relating to the global finance. The first objective is to introduce a set of issues and questions that are central to modern finance and macroeconomics, and that are genuinely interesting, such as: To provide students with the opportunity to understand the core theoretical models used in international macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, and how to use them to enhance their comprehension of real-world macroeconomic experiences, especially involving macroeconomic and financial policy.\nPrincipal Learning Outcomes: #By the end of the module, the student should have the theoretical and empirical tools and knowledge to understand current academic and policy debates in international finance. In addition, it is expected that the student will have an understanding of a wide variety of theoretical models commonly used in global finance; an ability to present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams as appropriate; an understanding of the relationship between different models, and how to apply them in the analysis of recent global finance episodes and policy discussions affecting actual economies and business world.\nIntellectual and Practical Skills: # The ability to analyse facts and circumstances to determine the cause of a problem and identifying and selecting appropriate solutions. Conceptual and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Numeracy and quantitative skills to manipulate data, evaluate, estimate, and model business problems, functions, and phenomena. Required Readings: #There is no textbook for this course. The required readings consist of a collection of book chapters, journal articles, and working papers. Note that these readings may be subject to change. I will post the required readings before each class on the course website. The reading list includes many non-required readings. These are intended for those students that would like to deepen their understanding of a topic, particularly those that may be interested in working on the topic for their dissertation.\nMain References #The course is based on lecture notes/slides which will be posted in course page prior to the lectures. Participation in lectures together with studying the lecture notes, is sufficient to succeed on the course. The lecturer will make available all the slides used in lectures.

Focusing on the financial system and monetary policy, this course looks at key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, banking, monetary policy and importantly their interaction and how this impacts the real world. The course will relate this to recent economic events which have reverberated worldwide. It is particularly suitable for students wishing to enter careers in financial markets or further study in this area.\nThe Money and Banking course will look at some key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, monetary policy and banking and how their interactions affect the real world.\nThe financial system has undergone many changes since the credit crunch and the Central Banks have had the unenviable task of stimulating the economy, encouraging lending, managing inflation and exchange rates. This course will focus on the financial system and monetary policy in countries around the world and present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations, evaluating their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis.\nCourse Outline #The focus of the course will be the theory and practice of monetary policy institutions. Within this, the interaction between the financial system (in terms of its institutions and instruments) and the macroeconomy will be examined and there will be a strong practical and policy related element to the course. The course will present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations and evaluate their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis. A broad range of topics will be analysed, including how bank runs develop and a discussion of the financial crises in the US and the Eurozone and their different experiences. The course will also introduce the students to some of the state of the art methods applied in modern macroeconomics such as the new Keynesian models. The following list includes the topics that will be covered:\nMoney supply and the role of the banking sector Interest rates and rates of return The stock market and financial market efficiency Monetary policy and monetary rules New Keynesian macroeconomic models Financial crises and regulation The 2008’s financial crisis and monetary policy responses Course Aims #This course aims to draw on recent financial events from across the world and provide students with a detailed understanding of the economic theory behind the way in which monetary policy can be designed and implemented. By focussing on the interactions between monetary policy, banking and financial markets, this course will give students the tools they need to understand and evaluate these links and apply their findings to real world applications in a variety of countries. Students taking this course will gain a greater awareness of the key elements of the financial system and the roles played by different financial assets. The course aims to give students greater awareness of the monetary transmission mechanism and how we can use modern empirical methods to understand it.\nThere are important economic lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis and this course will aim to relate relevant economic theory and applications to recent events which have reverberated worldwide. With the aim of developing students’ knowledge and understanding of the complex interactions between monetary policy, financial markets, banks and the economic situation, this course will be ideal for anyone looking to further their knowledge in monetary and financial economics, perhaps with an aim of pursuing a career in this field or undertaking postgraduate study. It will therefore aim to provide students with a rare opportunity to combine academic theory with their interest in a future career in such a direct manner.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this module, students should be able to:\nUnderstand the main elements of the financial system. Apply both micro and macro theory to real-world situations in the areas of money and banking. Outline and give a detailed justification of the main goals of monetary policy. Assess the relative merits of different countries’ monetary policy institutions. Critically discuss and debate a range of current monetary issues. Express their views about pertinent monetary and fiscal issues and evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams. Course Structure #For this course, there will be 4 hours of teaching on most weekdays, comprised of lectures and small group teaching. The structure will be:\n3 hours of lectures. A 1 hour seminar in small groups. Students will also be given time each day for independent study. Towards the end of the third week, students will also be provided with time for revision.\nDue to the intensive nature of the Warwick Summer School, students are expected to attend all timetabled teaching activity, to engage with the teaching material and to spend an average of 2-3 hours per day in self-guided study.\nStudents registered for Warwick Summer School must attain a minimum of 75% authorised attendance of the timetabled teaching activity.

This course covers three significant areas: the evolving landscape of digital currencies like Bitcoin and their potential to redefine traditional monetary systems; the vital role of central banks in addressing the global climate crisis and maintaining financial stability; and the impact of big financial data, AI, machine learning, and algorithmic trading on financial markets. Each topic is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of current and emerging trends in finance and economics, equipping them with insights into the challenges and opportunities in today\u0026rsquo;s interconnected financial world.\nBitcoin, cryptocurrency, central bank digital currency: Will Bitcoin become the money of the future? #In each single day, people around the world make more than 2 billion digital payments. Each of these transactions rely on the monetary system – the set of institutions and arrangements that surround and support monetary exchange. In other words a centralised system. This centralised system with the central bank at its centre has served society well. Yet digital innovation is expanding the frontier of technological possibilities, placing new demands on the system. Many believe that Bitcoin will replace the dollar and will be the money of the future. We will try to answer this question by considering other cryptocurrency and financial technology by comparison todays financial markets.\nGlobal Climate Crises and Financial Stability #The era of one policy objective –inflation targeting– and one tool – interest rates – is over for the central banks for the sake of financial stability. Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too. In this theme, we are going to understand the channels and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective monetary policy (green central banking) can help to shape the works of financial market and increase the policy effectiveness.\nBig Financial Data, AI, Machine Learning and Algorithm Trade. #Big financial data refers to large, diverse and complex data sets that has a potential to provide solutions to long-standing business challenges. In other words, big data is completely revolutionising in many different areas for the financial world. In this course we are going to look at how financial institutions can use real time big data to improve the ability for dealing with fraudulent activities, or how the functioning of financial markets will be changed. For example, trade pattern in stock exchanges all around world are going to be affected by algorithm trade by utilising high frequency data.\n","date":"10 August 2023","permalink":"/blog/finance21/","section":"Blog|News","summary":"I teach an engaging summer school course at the University of Warwick, specifically tailored for about 200 pre-university students from across the world.

This guide will step you through the process and highlight things you need to consider.\nStep 1: Upgrade Hugo # Congo 2.0 requires a minimum of Hugo v0.87.0 or later Congo is built to take advantage of some of the latest Hugo features. You should regularly keep your Hugo installation up to date to avoid any issues.\nYou can check your current version using the command hugo version. Visit the Hugo docs for information on obtaining a newer release for your platform.\nStep 2: Upgrade Congo #The process for upgrading Congo will depend on how you include the theme in your project. Instructions for each method can be found below.\nUpgrade using Hugo Upgrade using git Upgrade manually Upgrade using Hugo #To upgrade a go module to a new major release, the modules.toml and go.mod files need to be updated. In each file, update the path to the theme from github.com/jpanther/congo to github.com/jpanther/congo/v2.\nThen change into your project directory and execute the following command:\nhugo mod get -u Note that in some circumstances there may be issues with this step due to the way that Hugo locally caches modules. If the command above doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, try using hugo mod clean to clear out the local cache and re-download any modules.\nOnce the theme has been upgraded, continue to the next section.\nUpgrade using git #Git submodules can be upgraded using the git command. Simply execute the following command and the latest version of the theme will be downloaded into your local repository:\ngit submodule update --remote --merge Once the submodule has been upgraded, continue to the next section.\nUpgrade manually #Updating Congo manually requires you to download the latest copy of the theme and replace the old version in your project.\nNote that any local customisations you have made to the theme files will be lost during this process. Download the latest release of the theme source code.\nDownload from Github Extract the archive, rename the folder to congo and move it to the themes/ directory inside your Hugo project\u0026rsquo;s root folder. You will need to overwrite the existing directory to replace all the theme files.\nContinue to the next section.\nStep 3: Theme configuration #Congo 2.0 introduces a number of new theme configuration parameters. Although the theme will adapt to existing version 1 configurations, in order to take advantage of some of the newer theme features, you will need to adjust your existing configuration.\nThe simplest way to do this is to take a copy of the theme\u0026rsquo;s default configuration and compare it to your existing files. The process is outlined in greater detail below.\nLanguages.toml #In order to provide multilingual support, language-specific theme parameters have been moved to a new config file languages.[lang-code].toml. The theme comes with a template languages.en.toml file which can be used as a guide.\nThis step is optional if you do not need multilingual support, although completing it now will make future theme upgrades easier. The languages config file follows this structure:\n# config/_default/languagues.en.toml languageCode = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; languageName = \u0026#34;English\u0026#34; displayName = \u0026#34;EN\u0026#34; htmlCode = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; weight = 1 rtl = false # Language-specific parameters go here Using your preferred language, simply create this new file in config/_default/ and then move the language-specific parameters from any existing config files over to this new file. The table below outlines the parameters that need to be moved.\nParameter Old location title config.toml description params.toml copyright config.toml dateFormat params.toml [author] config.toml Once the values have been moved to the new location, these parameters should be deleted from their original locations.\nMenus.toml #As the theme is now aware of languages, the menus.toml file should also be renamed to include a language code. Rename the existing menus.toml to menus.[lang-code].toml, where the language code matches the code used in the languages.toml file in the previous section.\nConfig.toml #The config.toml file now only contains base Hugo configuration values. Other than removing the language-specific strings above, there are only two changes to consider.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using a language other than English, provide a defaultContentLanguage value that matches the language code in the config file you created for your language. Secondly, to take advange of the new site search in Congo 2.0, an [outputs] block needs to be provided.\n# config/_default/config.toml defaultContentLanguage = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; enableRobotsTXT = true paginate = 10 summaryLength = 0 [outputs] home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RSS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JSON\u0026#34;] Markup.toml #Congo 2.0 adds support for tables of contents on article pages. Although Hugo ships with default settings for generating contents listings, you can adjust this behaviour by adding a new [tableOfContents] block to your markup.toml file.\nThe recommended settings are as follows, which includes any headings in the Markdown content at levels 2, 3 and 4:\n# config/_default/markup.toml [tableOfContents] startLevel = 2 endLevel = 4 Params.toml #A number of new theme parameters have been introduced in Congo 2.0. Some minor changes are requried to existing configurations. Remember, the theme will always revert to a sensible default if a parameter is not provided.\nThe way that dark mode works in Congo has been changed to allow greater flexibility around configuration. The old darkMode and darkToggle parameters have been removed and replaced by three new parameters. These new options operate independently of each other, making it possible to force the appearance while still allowing the user to override.\nNew parameter Type Default Description defaultAppearance String \u0026quot;light\u0026quot; Default theme appearance; either light or dark.\n⚠️ Setting this to light replicates the old darkMode = false setting, while dark replicates darkMode = true. autoSwitchAppearance Boolean true Whether the theme appearance automatically switches based upon the operating system preference. Set to false to force the site to always use the defaultAppearance. ⚠️ Setting this to true replicates the old darkMode = \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; setting. showAppearanceSwitcher Boolean false Whether the theme appearance switcher is dispalyed in the site footer. ⚠️ This parameter replaces darkToggle. The following table outlines some other key new parameters that control new features in version 2:\nNew parameter Type Default enableSearch Boolean false showScrollToTop Boolean true article.showTaxonomies Boolean false article.showTableOfContents Boolean false list.showTableOfContents Boolean false For the full list of supported parameters, refer to the Configuration docs.\nStep 4: Move assets #All site assets, with the exception of favicons, now use Hugo Pipes to build an optimised version of your project. In order for the theme to locate your files, any previously static theme assets need to be moved to the Hugo assets folder. Primarily this is the author image and site logo:\nstatic/me.jpg → assets/me.jpg\nstatic/logo.jpg → assets/logo.jpg\nIf you have provided an author image or site logo, simply move these assets from static/ to assets/. If you use the same directory structure the theme will know where to find these files automatically. If you would like to provide a new path, update the logo and author.image config values accordingly.\nNote that this step does not apply to any assets in your project that are actually static. For example, a PDF file that you link directly to from within an article is a static asset. These files should remain in the static/ directory to ensure they are copied to the output folder when Hugo builds the site.\nStep 5: Check content #The behavior of the figure shortcode is different in version 2. If you are using figure in your content and have advanced use cases, you may need to adjust the parameters you are providing.\nConsult the shortcode docs to learn more about supported parameters.\nStep 6: Rebuild #Now that all the configuration changes are complete, it\u0026rsquo;s time to rebuild the site. Run hugo, or your build command, and check that everything works as expected.\nIf you come across any errors, check the configuration is correct and refer to the full documentation for further guidance. Remember, the example config files bundled with the theme contain all the default parameters and are a great starting point.\n🙋‍♀️ If you still need help, feel free to ask your question on GitHub Discussions.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/docs/version-2/upgrade/","section":"Documentation","summary":"Although Congo 2.","title":"Upgrading from Congo 1.x"},{"content":"Although Congo 2.0 contains a large number of changes, the theme has been designed to minimise the effort required to upgrade to the latest release.\nThat said, there are some changes that require adjustments to existing sites that are built with Congo version 1.x.

Teaching Philosophy #My teaching philosophy is deeply inspired by Richard Feynman (illustrated above), a renowned physicist known not just for his groundbreaking research but also for his exceptional teaching skills. Feynman\u0026rsquo;s ability to unravel complex scientific concepts into understandable, engaging narratives profoundly resonated with me. His passionate and straightforward approach in explaining intricate theories set a high standard for educational excellence. He embodied the essence of making learning enjoyable and accessible, an ethos I strive to emulate in my own teaching. His unique method of fostering curiosity and critical thinking among students, often referred to as the Feynman Technique has been a guiding principle in my journey as an educator. In every course I teach, I aim to channel his enthusiasm for discovery and clarity, ensuring that my students not only grasp the theoretical aspects of Finance and Economics but also appreciate their practical applications in the real world.\nCourses #Courses for Masters # Topics in Global Finance (EC916) - Department of Economics - Module Leader\nMacroeconomics (EC956) - Warwick Business School - Module Leader\nEconomic Analysis (EC9DA) - Department of Economics - Lead Tutor\nCourses for Undergraduate # Quantitative Economics (EC106) - Dept of Math. - Module|Section Leader\nMacroeconomics 2 (EC201) - Dept of Economics - Lead Tutor\nFinancial Economics (EC333) - Department of Economics - Tutor\nResearch in Applied Economics (EC331) - Dept. of Economics - Supervisor\nCourses for Summer School # Money, Banking and Finance - Module Leader\nFinance in the 21st Century (Including Cryptocurrencies) - Module Leader\nDissertation Supervision # Textual Analysis (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing)\nQuantitative Finance (Asset Pricing, Financial Economics)\nMacroeconomics (Central Banking, Monetary Economics, International Macroeconomics)\n","date":"16 August 2020","permalink":"/teaching/","section":"fatih.ai","summary":"Learn how to get up and running using Hugo and Congo from a completely blank state.

The config files that ship with Congo contain all of the possible settings that the theme recognises. By default, many of these are commented out but you can simply uncomment them to activate or change a specific feature.\nBasic configuration #Before creating any content, there are a few things you should set for a new installation. Starting in the config.toml file, set the baseURL and languageCode parameters. The languageCode should be set to the main language that you will be using to author your content.\n# config/_default/config.toml baseURL = \u0026#34;https://your_domain.com/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; The next step is to configure the language settings. Although Congo supports multilingual setups, for now, just configure the main language.\nLocate the languages.en.toml file in the config folder. If your main language is English you can use this file as is. Otherwise, rename it so that it includes the correct language code in the filename. For example, for French, rename the file to languages.fr.toml.\nThe language code in the language config filename should match the languageCode setting in config.toml. # config/_default/languages.en.toml title = \u0026#34;My awesome website\u0026#34; [params.author] name = \u0026#34;My name\u0026#34; image = \u0026#34;img/author.jpg\u0026#34; headline = \u0026#34;A generally awesome human\u0026#34; bio = \u0026#34;A little bit about me\u0026#34; links = [ { twitter = \u0026#34;https://twitter.com/username\u0026#34; } ] The [params.author] configuration determines how the author information is displayed on the website. The image should be placed in the site\u0026rsquo;s assets/ folder. Links will be displayed in the order they are listed.\nIf you need extra detail, further information about each of these configuration options, is covered in the Configuration section.\nColour schemes #Congo ships with a number of colour schemes out of the box. To change the scheme, simply set the colorScheme theme parameter. Valid options are congo (default), avocado, cherry, fire, ocean, sapphire and slate.\nThe colourScheme value should be provided in lowercase. # config/_default/params.toml colorScheme = \u0026#34;congo\u0026#34; Congo defines a three-colour palette that is used throughout the theme. Each main colour contains ten shades which are based upon the colours that are included in Tailwind.\nCongo (default) # Avocado # Cherry # Fire # Ocean # Sapphire # Slate # Although these are the default schemes, you can also create your own. Refer to the Advanced Customisation section for details.\nOrganising content #By default, Congo doesn\u0026rsquo;t force you to use a particular content type. In doing so you are free to define your content as you wish. You might prefer pages for a static site, posts for a blog, or projects for a portfolio.\nDirectory structure #Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick overview of a basic Congo project. All content is placed within the content folder:\n. ├── assets │ └── img │ └── author.jpg ├── config │ └── _default ├── content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── about.md │ └── posts │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-post.md │ └── another-post │ ├── aardvark.jpg │ └── index.md └── themes └── congo The key thing to note here is that within the content directory, normal article pages are named index.md while list pages are named _index.md. Any assets that go along with the article should be placed in a sub-directory alongside the index file. It\u0026rsquo;s important to have a firm grasp of how Hugo expects content to be organised as the theme is designed to take full advantage of Hugo page bundles. Be sure to read the official Hugo docs for more information.\nFeature, cover and thumbnail images #The Congo theme supports displaying images on article listings and at the top of individual article pages. There are three types of images supported, each with their own use case: feature, cover and thumb.\nIn the example below, a cover and thumb image have been provided for the first-post article:\n. └── content └── posts ├── _index.md └── first-post ├── cover.jpg ├── index.md └── thumb.jpg The thumb image is used as the article thumbnail and will be displayed in article lists, and the cover image will be displayed at the top of the article content on individual article pages.\nThis example shows an article with a thumbnail image. In order to provide maximum performance, thumbnail images are automatically cropped and resized to a 4:3 ratio. Cover images will be automatically resized to fit their content, but any ratio is permitted. The feature image is a special type, and when present, it will be used in place of both the thumb and cover images. Feature images are also present in the article metadata, which is included when content is shared to third-party networks like Facebook and Twitter.\nThe theme will intelligently detect article images and automatically add them to your site. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to refer to them in the front matter and simply need to place an appropriately named file within the page resources. If the term feature, cover or thumb is found anywhere in the image filename, then it will be used for that purpose.\nThe Samples section provides a number of examples of these images (and you can view the source code to see the file structure).\nTaxonomies #Congo is also flexible when it comes to taxonomies. Some people prefer to use tags and categories to group their content, others prefer to use topics.\nHugo defaults to using posts, tags and categories out of the box and this will work fine if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want. If you wish to customise this, however, you can do so by creating a taxonomies.toml configuration file:\n# config/_default/taxonomies.toml topic = \u0026#34;topics\u0026#34; This will replace the default tags and categories with topics. Refer to the Hugo Taxonomy docs for more information on naming taxonomies.\nWhen you create a new taxonomy, you will need to adjust the navigation links on the website to point to the correct sections, which is covered below.\nMenus #Congo has two menus that can be customised to suit the content and layout of your site. The main menu appears in the site header and the footer menu appears at the bottom of the page just above the copyright notice.\nBoth menus are configured in the menus.en.toml file. Similarly to the languages config file, if you wish to use another language, rename this file and replace en with the language code you wish to use. Menu links will be sorted from lowest to highest weight, and then alphabetically by name.\n# config/_default/menus.en.toml [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Blog\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Topics\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;topics\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;GitHub\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/jpanther/congo\u0026#34; weight = 30 [main.params] icon = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; showName = false target = \u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34; [[main]] identifier = \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; weight = 99 [main.params] action = \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; icon = \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Privacy\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;privacy\u0026#34; Basic links #The name parameter specifies the text that is used in the menu link. You can also optionally provide a title which fills the HTML title attribute for the link.\nThe pageRef parameter allows you to easily reference Hugo content pages and taxonomies. It is the quickest way to configure the menu as you can simply refer to any Hugo content item and it will automatically build the correct link. To link to external URLs, the url parameter can be used.\nFurther customisation can be achieved through the use of special theme parameters. Providing params within a link allows the addition of an icon, the ability to toggle the link text with showName and to optionally set a target for the URL. In the example above, the GitHub link will only display as an icon and will open the link in a new window.\nAction links #There is a special case for creating menu items for links that take theme actions. These are denoted using the action parameter, and a value of the action the link should perform. Action links allow for all the same custom parameters as other links and can be styled with an icon or text name.\nThere are three valid theme actions:\nappearance will create a link to the appearance switcher locale will create a drop down picker to access translated content search will create a link to the site search Both menus are completely optional and can be commented out if not required. Use the template provided in the default file as a guide.\nDetailed configuration #The steps above are the bare minimum configuration. If you now run hugo server you will be presented with a blank Congo website. Detailed configuration is covered in the Configuration section.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/docs/getting-started/","section":"Documentation","summary":"This section assumes you have already installed the Congo theme and are ready to start with basic configuration tasks like selecting a colour scheme, menu and content structure.","title":"Getting Started"},{"content":" This section assumes you have already installed the Congo theme.

Menu links will be sorted from lowest to highest weight, and then alphabetically by name.\n# config/_default/menus.en.toml [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Blog\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Topics\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;topics\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;GitHub\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/jpanther/congo\u0026#34; weight = 30 [main.params] icon = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; showName = false target = \u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34; [[main]] identifier = \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; weight = 99 [main.params] action = \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; icon = \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Privacy\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;privacy\u0026#34; Basic links #The name parameter specifies the text that is used in the menu link. You can also optionally provide a title which fills the HTML title attribute for the link.\nThe pageRef parameter allows you to easily reference Hugo content pages and taxonomies. It is the quickest way to configure the menu as you can simply refer to any Hugo content item and it will automatically build the correct link. To link to external URLs, the url parameter can be used.\nFurther customisation can be achieved through the use of special theme parameters. Providing params within a link allows the addition of an icon, the ability to toggle the link text with showName and to optionally set a target for the URL. In the example above, the GitHub link will only display as an icon and will open the link in a new window.\nAction links #There is a special case for creating menu items for links that take theme actions. These are denoted using the action parameter, and a value of the action the link should perform. Action links allow for all the same custom parameters as other links and can be styled with an icon or text name.\nThere are three valid theme actions:\nappearance will create a link to the appearance switcher locale will create a drop down picker to access translated content search will create a link to the site search Both menus are completely optional and can be commented out if not required.

Congo includes a number of built-in icons for social, links and other purposes. Check the icon samples page for a full list of supported icons.\nCustom icons can be added by providing your own icon assets in the assets/icons/ directory of your project. The icon can then be referenced in the shortcode by using the SVG filename without the .svg extension.\nIcons can also be used in partials by calling the icon partial.\nKatex #The katex shortcode can be used to add mathematical expressions to article content using the KaTeX package. Refer to the online reference of supported TeX functions for the available syntax.\nTo include mathematical expressions in an article, simply place the shortcode anywhere with the content. It only needs to be included once per article and KaTeX will automatically render any markup on that page. Both inline and block notation are supported.\nInline notation can be generated by wrapping the expression in \\\\( and \\\\) delimiters. Alternatively, block notation can be generated using $$ delimiters.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; katex \u0026gt;}} \\\\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\\\) \\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\)\nCheck out the mathematical notation samples page for more examples.\nLead #lead is used to bring emphasis to the start of an article. It can be used to style an introduction, or to call out an important piece of information. Simply wrap any Markdown content in the lead shortcode.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; lead \u0026gt;}} When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. {{\u0026lt; /lead \u0026gt;}} When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Mermaid #mermaid allows you to draw detailed diagrams and visualisations using text. It uses Mermaid under the hood and supports a wide variety of diagrams, charts and other output formats.\nSimply write your Mermaid syntax within the mermaid shortcode and let the plugin do the rest.\nRefer to the official Mermaid docs for details on syntax and supported diagram types.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} graph LR; A[Lemons]--\u0026gt;B[Lemonade]; B--\u0026gt;C[Profit] {{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}} graph LR; A[Lemons]--\u003eB[Lemonade]; B--\u003eC[Profit] You can see some additional Mermaid examples on the diagrams and flowcharts samples page.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/docs/shortcodes/","section":"Documentation","summary":"Congo includes several shortcodes for adding rich content to articles including images, charts, diagrams, buttons and more.","title":"Shortcodes"},{"content":"In addition to all the default Hugo shortcodes, Congo adds a few extras for additional functionality.\nAlert #alert outputs its contents as a stylised message box within your article.

Simply use the following format and the theme will handle the rest:\n![Alt text](image.jpg \u0026#34;Image caption\u0026#34;) Example:\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026#34;abstract.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Abstract purple artwork\u0026#34; caption=\u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;!-- OR --\u0026gt; ![Abstract purple artwork](abstract.jpg \u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34;) Photo by Jr Korpa on Unsplash Icon #icon outputs an SVG icon and takes the icon name as its only parameter. The icon is scaled to match the current text size.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; icon \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Output: Icons are populated using Hugo pipelines which makes them very flexible. Congo includes a number of built-in icons for social, links and other purposes. Check the icon samples page for a full list of supported icons.\nCustom icons can be added by providing your own icon assets in the assets/icons/ directory of your project. The icon can then be referenced in the shortcode by using the SVG filename without the .svg extension.\nIcons can also be used in partials by calling the icon partial.\nKatex #The katex shortcode can be used to add mathematical expressions to article content using the KaTeX package. Refer to the online reference of supported TeX functions for the available syntax.\nTo include mathematical expressions in an article, simply place the shortcode anywhere with the content. It only needs to be included once per article and KaTeX will automatically render any markup on that page. Both inline and block notation are supported.\nInline notation can be generated by wrapping the expression in \\\\( and \\\\) delimiters. Alternatively, block notation can be generated using $$ delimiters.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; katex \u0026gt;}} \\\\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\\\) \\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\)\nCheck out the mathematical notation samples page for more examples.\nLead #lead is used to bring emphasis to the start of an article. It can be used to style an introduction, or to call out an important piece of information. Simply wrap any Markdown content in the lead shortcode.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; lead \u0026gt;}} When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. {{\u0026lt; /lead \u0026gt;}} When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Mermaid #mermaid allows you to draw detailed diagrams and visualisations using text. It uses Mermaid under the hood and supports a wide variety of diagrams, charts and other output formats.\nSimply write your Mermaid syntax within the mermaid shortcode and let the plugin do the rest.\nRefer to the official Mermaid docs for details on syntax and supported diagram types.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} graph LR; A[Lemons]--\u0026gt;B[Lemonade]; B--\u0026gt;C[Profit] {{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}} graph LR; A[Lemons]--\u003eB[Lemonade]; B--\u003eC[Profit] You can see some additional Mermaid examples on the diagrams and flowcharts samples page.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/shortcodes/","section":"Projects","summary":"Congo includes several shortcodes for adding rich content to articles including images, charts, diagrams, buttons and more.","title":"Shortcodes"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/analytics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Analytics"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/comments/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Comments"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/favicons/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Favicons"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/partials/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Partials"},{"content":"Analytics #Congo provides support for various analytics providers out of the box, as well as the ability to include custom code for any provider of your choice.

This page is designed to pull everything together and offer some worked examples that you might like to use in your Hugo project.\nTip: If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hugo, be sure to check out the official docs to learn more about the concept of page bundles and resources. The examples on this page can all be adapted to different scenarios but hopefully give you some ideas about how to approach formatting a particular content item for your individual project.\nBranch pages #Branch page bundles in Hugo cover items like the homepage, section listings, and taxonomy pages. The important thing to remember about branch bundles is that the filename for this content type is _index.md.\nCongo will honour the front matter parameters specified in branch pages and these will override the default settings for that particular page. For example, setting the title parameter in a branch page will allow overriding the page title.\nHomepage # Layout: layouts/index.html Content: content/_index.md The homepage in Congo is special in that it\u0026rsquo;s overarching design is controlled by the homepage layout config parameter. You can learn more about this in the Homepage Layout section.\nIf you want to add custom content to this page, you simply need to create a content/_index.md file. Anything in this file will then be included in your homepage.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Welcome to Congo!\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This is a demo of adding content to the homepage.\u0026#34; --- Welcome to my website! I\u0026#39;m really happy you stopped by. This example sets a custom title and adds some additional text to the body of the page. Any Markdown formatted text is acceptable, including shortcodes, images and links.\nList pages # Layout: layouts/_default/list.html Content: content/../_index.md List pages group all the pages within into a section and provide a way for visitors to reach each page. A blog or portfolio are examples of a list page as they group together posts or projects.\nCreating a list page is as simple as making a sub-directory in the content folder. For example, to create a \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; section, you would create content/projects/. Then create a Markdown file for each of your projects.\nA list page will be generated by default, however to customise the content, you should also create an _index.md page in this new directory.\n. └── content └── projects ├── _index.md # /projects ├── first-project.md # /projects/first-project └── another-project ├── index.md # /projects/another-project └── project.jpg Hugo will generate URLs for the pages in your projects folder accordingly.\nJust like the homepage, content in the _index.md file will be output into the generated list index. Congo will then list any pages in this section below the content.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Projects\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;Learn about some of my projects.\u0026#34; cascade: showReadingTime: false --- This section contains all my current projects. In this example, the special cascade parameter is being used to hide the reading time on any sub-pages within this section. By doing this, any project pages will not have their reading time showing. This is a great way to override default theme parameters for an entire section without having to include them in every individual page.\nThe samples section of this site is an example of a list page.\nTaxonomy pages # List layout: layouts/_default/taxonomy.html Term layout: layouts/_default/term.html Content: content/../_index.md Taxonomy pages come in two forms - taxonomy lists and taxonomy terms. Lists display a listing of each of the terms within a given taxonomy, while terms display a list of pages that are related to a given term.\nThe terminology can get a little confusing so let\u0026rsquo;s explore an example using a taxonomy named animals.\nFirstly, to use taxonomies in Hugo, they have to be configured. This is done by creating a config file at config/_default/taxonomies.toml and defining the taxonomy name.\n# config/_default/taxonomies.toml animal = \u0026#34;animals\u0026#34; Hugo expects taxonomies to be listed using their singular and plural forms, so we add the singular animal equals the plural animals to create our example taxonomy.\nNow that our animals taxonomy exists, it needs to be added to individual content items. It\u0026rsquo;s as simple as inserting it into the front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Into the Lion\u0026#39;s Den\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This week we\u0026#39;re learning about lions.\u0026#34; animals: [\u0026#34;lion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;] --- This has now created two terms within our animals taxonomy - lion and cat.\nAlthough it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious at this point, Hugo will now be generating list and term pages for this new taxonomy. By default the listing can be accessed at /animals/ and the term pages can be found at /animals/lion/ and /animals/cat/.\nThe list page will list all the terms contained within the taxonomy. In this example, navigating to /animals/ will show a page that has links for \u0026ldquo;lion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; which take visitors to the individual term pages.\nThe term pages will list all the pages contained within that term. These term lists are essentially the same as normal list pages and behave in much the same way.\nIn order to add custom content to taxonomy pages, simply create _index.md files in the content folder using the taxonomy name as the sub-directory name.\n. └── content └── animals ├── _index.md # /animals └── lion └── _index.md # /animals/lion Anything in these content files will now be placed onto the generated taxonomy pages. As with other content, the front matter variables can be used to override defaults. In this way you could have a tag named lion but override the title to be \u0026ldquo;Lion\u0026rdquo;.\nTo see how this looks in reality, check out the tags taxonomy listing on this site.\nLeaf pages # Layout: layouts/_default/single.html Content (standalone): content/../page-name.md Content (bundled): content/../page-name/index.md Leaf pages in Hugo are basically standard content pages. They are defined as pages that don\u0026rsquo;t contain any sub-pages. These could be things like an about page, or an individual blog post that lives in the blog section of the website.\nThe most important thing to remember about leaf pages is that unlike branch pages, leaf pages should be named index.md without an underscore. Leaf pages are also special in that they can be grouped together at the top level of the section and named with a unique name.\n. └── content └── blog ├── first-post.md # /blog/first-post ├── second-post.md # /blog/second-post └── third-post ├── index.md # /blog/third-post └── image.jpg When including assets in a page, like an image, a page bundle should be used. Page bundles are created using a sub-directory with an index.md file. Grouping the assets with the content in its own directory is important as many of the shortcodes and other theme logic assumes that resources are bundled alongside pages.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Blog Post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 description: \u0026#34;Welcome to my blog!\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;Learn more about me and why I am starting this blog.\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;welcome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;new\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;about\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;] --- _This_ is the content of my blog post. Leaf pages have a wide variety of front matter parameters that can be used to customise how they are displayed.\nExternal links #Congo has a special feature that allows links to external pages to appear alongside articles in the article listings. This is useful if you have content on third party websites like Medium, or research papers that you\u0026rsquo;d like to link to, without replicating the content in your Hugo site.\nIn order to create an external link article, some special front matter needs to be set:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My Medium post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 externalUrl: \u0026#34;https://medium.com/\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;I wrote a post on Medium.\u0026#34; showReadingTime: false _build: render: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; list: \u0026#34;local\u0026#34; --- Along with the normal front matter parameters like title and summary, the externalUrl parameter is used to tell Congo that this is not an ordinary article. The URL provided here will be where visitors are directed when they select this article.\nAdditionally, we use a special Hugo front matter parameter _build to prevent a normal page for this content being generated - there\u0026rsquo;s no point generating a page since we\u0026rsquo;re linking to an external URL!\nThe theme includes an archetype to make generating these external link articles simple. Just specify -k external when making new content.\nhugo new -k external posts/my-post.md Simple pages # Layout: layouts/_default/simple.html Front Matter: layout: \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot; Congo also includes a special layout for simple pages. The simple layout is a full-width template that just places Markdown content into the page without any special theme features.\nThe only features available in the simple layout are breadcrumbs and sharing links. However, the behaviour of these can still be controlled using the normal page front matter variables.\nTo enable the simple layout on a particular page, add the layout front matter variable with a value of \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot;:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My landing page\u0026#34; date: 2022-03-08 layout: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34; --- This page content is now full-width. Custom layouts #One of the benefits of Hugo is that it makes it easy to create custom layouts for the whole site, individual sections or pages.\nLayouts follow all the normal Hugo templating rules and more information is available in the official Hugo docs.\nOverriding default layouts #Each of the content types discussed above lists the layout file that is used to generate each type of page. If this file is created in your local project it will override the theme template and thus can be used to customise the default style of the website.\nFor example, creating a layouts/_default/single.html file will allow the layout of leaf pages to be completely customised.\nCustom section layouts #It is also simple to create custom layouts for individual content sections. This is useful when you want to make a section that lists a certain type of content using a particular style.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s step through an example that creates a custom \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; page that lists projects using a special layout.\nIn order to do this, structure your content using the normal Hugo content rules and create a section for your projects. Additionally, create a new layout for the projects section by using the same directory name as the content and adding a list.html file.\n. └── content │ └── projects │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-project.md │ └── second-project.md └── layouts └── projects └── list.html This list.html file will now override the default list template, but only for the projects section.

The metadata in the front matter for each project is used to determine which information is displayed.\nKeep in mind that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to ensure the relevant styles and classes are available, which may require the Tailwind CSS to be recompiled. This is discussed in more detail in the Advanced Customisation section.\nWhen making custom templates like this one, it\u0026rsquo;s always easiest to take a look at how the default Congo template works and then use that as a guide. Remember, the Hugo docs are a great resource to learn more about creating templates too.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/docs/content-examples/","section":"Documentation","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s time to bring everything together with some examples that demonstrate how content should be created and structured.","title":"Content Examples"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading the documentation in order, you should now know about all the features and configurations available in Congo. This page is designed to pull everything together and offer some worked examples that you might like to use in your Hugo project.\nTip: If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hugo, be sure to check out the official docs to learn more about the concept of page bundles and resources. The examples on this page can all be adapted to different scenarios but hopefully give you some ideas about how to approach formatting a particular content item for your individual project.\nBranch pages #Branch page bundles in Hugo cover items like the homepage, section listings, and taxonomy pages. The important thing to remember about branch bundles is that the filename for this content type is _index.md.\nCongo will honour the front matter parameters specified in branch pages and these will override the default settings for that particular page. For example, setting the title parameter in a branch page will allow overriding the page title.\nHomepage # Layout: layouts/index.html Content: content/_index.md The homepage in Congo is special in that it\u0026rsquo;s overarching design is controlled by the homepage layout config parameter. You can learn more about this in the Homepage Layout section.\nIf you want to add custom content to this page, you simply need to create a content/_index.md file. Anything in this file will then be included in your homepage.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Welcome to Congo!\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This is a demo of adding content to the homepage.\u0026#34; --- Welcome to my website! I\u0026#39;m really happy you stopped by. This example sets a custom title and adds some additional text to the body of the page. Any Markdown formatted text is acceptable, including shortcodes, images and links.\nList pages # Layout: layouts/_default/list.html Content: content/../_index.md List pages group all the pages within into a section and provide a way for visitors to reach each page. A blog or portfolio are examples of a list page as they group together posts or projects.\nCreating a list page is as simple as making a sub-directory in the content folder. For example, to create a \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; section, you would create content/projects/. Then create a Markdown file for each of your projects.\nA list page will be generated by default, however to customise the content, you should also create an _index.md page in this new directory.\n. └── content └── projects ├── _index.md # /projects ├── first-project.md # /projects/first-project └── another-project ├── index.md # /projects/another-project └── project.jpg Hugo will generate URLs for the pages in your projects folder accordingly.\nJust like the homepage, content in the _index.md file will be output into the generated list index. Congo will then list any pages in this section below the content.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Projects\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;Learn about some of my projects.\u0026#34; cascade: showReadingTime: false --- This section contains all my current projects. In this example, the special cascade parameter is being used to hide the reading time on any sub-pages within this section. By doing this, any project pages will not have their reading time showing. This is a great way to override default theme parameters for an entire section without having to include them in every individual page.\nThe samples section of this site is an example of a list page.\nTaxonomy pages # List layout: layouts/_default/taxonomy.html Term layout: layouts/_default/term.html Content: content/../_index.md Taxonomy pages come in two forms - taxonomy lists and taxonomy terms. Lists display a listing of each of the terms within a given taxonomy, while terms display a list of pages that are related to a given term.\nThe terminology can get a little confusing so let\u0026rsquo;s explore an example using a taxonomy named animals.\nFirstly, to use taxonomies in Hugo, they have to be configured. This is done by creating a config file at config/_default/taxonomies.toml and defining the taxonomy name.\n# config/_default/taxonomies.toml animal = \u0026#34;animals\u0026#34; Hugo expects taxonomies to be listed using their singular and plural forms, so we add the singular animal equals the plural animals to create our example taxonomy.\nNow that our animals taxonomy exists, it needs to be added to individual content items. It\u0026rsquo;s as simple as inserting it into the front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Into the Lion\u0026#39;s Den\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This week we\u0026#39;re learning about lions.\u0026#34; animals: [\u0026#34;lion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;] --- This has now created two terms within our animals taxonomy - lion and cat.\nAlthough it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious at this point, Hugo will now be generating list and term pages for this new taxonomy. By default the listing can be accessed at /animals/ and the term pages can be found at /animals/lion/ and /animals/cat/.\nThe list page will list all the terms contained within the taxonomy. In this example, navigating to /animals/ will show a page that has links for \u0026ldquo;lion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; which take visitors to the individual term pages.\nThe term pages will list all the pages contained within that term. These term lists are essentially the same as normal list pages and behave in much the same way.\nIn order to add custom content to taxonomy pages, simply create _index.md files in the content folder using the taxonomy name as the sub-directory name.\n. └── content └── animals ├── _index.md # /animals └── lion └── _index.md # /animals/lion Anything in these content files will now be placed onto the generated taxonomy pages. As with other content, the front matter variables can be used to override defaults. In this way you could have a tag named lion but override the title to be \u0026ldquo;Lion\u0026rdquo;.\nTo see how this looks in reality, check out the tags taxonomy listing on this site.\nLeaf pages # Layout: layouts/_default/single.html Content (standalone): content/../page-name.md Content (bundled): content/../page-name/index.md Leaf pages in Hugo are basically standard content pages. They are defined as pages that don\u0026rsquo;t contain any sub-pages. These could be things like an about page, or an individual blog post that lives in the blog section of the website.\nThe most important thing to remember about leaf pages is that unlike branch pages, leaf pages should be named index.md without an underscore. Leaf pages are also special in that they can be grouped together at the top level of the section and named with a unique name.\n. └── content └── blog ├── first-post.md # /blog/first-post ├── second-post.md # /blog/second-post └── third-post ├── index.md # /blog/third-post └── image.jpg When including assets in a page, like an image, a page bundle should be used. Page bundles are created using a sub-directory with an index.md file. Grouping the assets with the content in its own directory is important as many of the shortcodes and other theme logic assumes that resources are bundled alongside pages.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Blog Post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 description: \u0026#34;Welcome to my blog!\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;Learn more about me and why I am starting this blog.\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;welcome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;new\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;about\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;] --- _This_ is the content of my blog post. Leaf pages have a wide variety of front matter parameters that can be used to customise how they are displayed.\nExternal links #Congo has a special feature that allows links to external pages to appear alongside articles in the article listings. This is useful if you have content on third party websites like Medium, or research papers that you\u0026rsquo;d like to link to, without replicating the content in your Hugo site.\nIn order to create an external link article, some special front matter needs to be set:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My Medium post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 externalUrl: \u0026#34;https://medium.com/\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;I wrote a post on Medium.\u0026#34; showReadingTime: false _build: render: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; list: \u0026#34;local\u0026#34; --- Along with the normal front matter parameters like title and summary, the externalUrl parameter is used to tell Congo that this is not an ordinary article. The URL provided here will be where visitors are directed when they select this article.\nAdditionally, we use a special Hugo front matter parameter _build to prevent a normal page for this content being generated - there\u0026rsquo;s no point generating a page since we\u0026rsquo;re linking to an external URL!\nThe theme includes an archetype to make generating these external link articles simple. Just specify -k external when making new content.\nhugo new -k external posts/my-post.md Simple pages # Layout: layouts/_default/simple.html Front Matter: layout: \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot; Congo also includes a special layout for simple pages. The simple layout is a full-width template that just places Markdown content into the page without any special theme features.\nThe only features available in the simple layout are breadcrumbs and sharing links. However, the behaviour of these can still be controlled using the normal page front matter variables.\nTo enable the simple layout on a particular page, add the layout front matter variable with a value of \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot;:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My landing page\u0026#34; date: 2022-03-08 layout: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34; --- This page content is now full-width. Custom layouts #One of the benefits of Hugo is that it makes it easy to create custom layouts for the whole site, individual sections or pages.\nLayouts follow all the normal Hugo templating rules and more information is available in the official Hugo docs.\nOverriding default layouts #Each of the content types discussed above lists the layout file that is used to generate each type of page. If this file is created in your local project it will override the theme template and thus can be used to customise the default style of the website.\nFor example, creating a layouts/_default/single.html file will allow the layout of leaf pages to be completely customised.\nCustom section layouts #It is also simple to create custom layouts for individual content sections. This is useful when you want to make a section that lists a certain type of content using a particular style.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s step through an example that creates a custom \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; page that lists projects using a special layout.\nIn order to do this, structure your content using the normal Hugo content rules and create a section for your projects. Additionally, create a new layout for the projects section by using the same directory name as the content and adding a list.html file.\n. └── content │ └── projects │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-project.md │ └── second-project.md └── layouts └── projects └── list.html This list.html file will now override the default list template, but only for the projects section. Before we look at this file, lets first look at the individual project files.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Congo\u0026#34; date: 2021-08-11 icon: \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;A theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS.\u0026#34; topics: [\u0026#34;Hugo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Web\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Tailwind\u0026#34;] externalUrl: \u0026#34;https://github.com/jpanther/congo/\u0026#34; --- In this example we are assigning some metadata for each project that we can then use in our list template.

Read below to learn more about what can be customised and the best way of achieving your desired result.\nIf you need further advice, post your questions on GitHub Discussions.\nHugo project structure #Before leaping into it, first a quick note about Hugo project structure and best practices for managing your content and theme customisations.\nIn summary: Never directly edit the theme files. Only make customisations in your Hugo project\u0026rsquo;s sub-directories, not in the themes directory itself. Congo is built to take advantage of all the standard Hugo practices. It is designed to allow all aspects of the theme to be customised and overridden without changing any of the core theme files. This allows for a seamless upgrade experience while giving you total control over the look and feel of your website.\nIn order to achieve this, you should never manually adjust any of the theme files directly. Whether you install using Hugo modules, as a git submodule or manually include the theme in your themes/ directory, you should always leave these files intact.\nThe correct way to adjust any theme behaviour is by overriding files using Hugo\u0026rsquo;s powerful file lookup order. In summary, the lookup order ensures any files you include in your project directory will automatically take precedence over any theme files.\nFor example, if you wanted to override the main article template in Congo, you can simply create your own layouts/_default/single.html file and place it in the root of your project. This file will then override the single.html from the theme without ever changing the theme itself. This works for any theme files - HTML templates, partials, shortcodes, config files, data, assets, etc.\nAs long as you follow this simple practice, you will always be able to update the theme (or test different theme versions) without worrying that you will lose any of your custom changes.\nColour schemes #Congo ships with a number of colour schemes out of the box. To change the basic colour scheme, you can set the colorScheme theme parameter. Refer to the Getting Started section to learn more about the built-in schemes.\nIn addition to the default schemes, you can also create your own and re-style the entire website to your liking. Schemes are created by by placing a \u0026lt;scheme-name\u0026gt;.css file in the assets/css/schemes/ folder. Once the file is created, simply refer to it by name in the theme configuration.\nCongo defines a three-colour palette that is used throughout the theme. The three colours are defined as neutral, primary and secondary variants, each containing ten shades of colour.\nDue to the way Tailwind CSS 3.0 calculates colour values with opacity, the colours specified in the scheme need to conform to a particular format by providing the red, green and blue colour values.\n:root { --color-primary-500: 139, 92, 246; } This example defines a CSS variable for the primary-500 colour with a red value of 139, green value of 92 and blue value of 246.\nUse one of the existing theme stylesheets as a template. You are free to define your own colours, but for some inspiration, check out the official Tailwind colour palette reference.\nOverriding the stylesheet #Sometimes you need to add a custom style to style your own HTML elements. Congo provides for this scenario by allowing you to override the default styles in your own CSS stylesheet. Simply create a custom.css file in your project\u0026rsquo;s assets/css/ folder.\nThe custom.css file will be minified by Hugo and loaded automatically after all the other theme styles which means anything in your custom file will take precedence over the defaults.\nAdjusting the font size #Changing the font size of your website is one example of overriding the default stylesheet. Congo makes this simple as it uses scaled font sizes throughout the theme which are derived from the base HTML font size. By default, Tailwind sets the default size to 12pt, but it can be changed to whatever value you prefer.\nCreate a custom.css file using the instructions above and add the following CSS declaration:\n/* Increase the default font size */ html { font-size: 13pt; } Simply by changing this one value, all the font sizes on your website will be adjusted to match this new size. Therefore, to increase the overall font sizes used, make the value greater than 12pt. Similarly, to decrease the font sizes, make the value less than 12pt.\nBuilding the theme CSS from source #If you\u0026rsquo;d like to make a major change, you can take advantage of Tailwind CSS\u0026rsquo;s JIT compiler and rebuild the entire theme CSS from scratch. This is useful if you want to adjust the Tailwind configuration or add extra Tailwind classes to the main stylesheet.\nNote: Building the theme manually is intended for advanced users. Let\u0026rsquo;s step through how building the Tailwind CSS works.\nTailwind configuration #In order to generate a CSS file that only contains the Tailwind classes that are actually being used the JIT compiler needs to scan through all the HTML templates and Markdown content files to check which styles are present in the markup. The compiler does this by looking at the tailwind.config.js file which is included in the root of the theme directory:\n// themes/congo/tailwind.config.js module.exports = { content: [ \u0026#34;./layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/congo/layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/congo/content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, ], // and more... }; This default configuration has been included with these content paths so that you can easily generate your own CSS file without needing to modify it, provided you follow a particular project structure. Namely, you have to include Congo in your project as a subdirectory at themes/congo/. This means you cannot easily use Hugo Modules to install the theme and you must go down either the git submodule (recommended) or manual install routes. The Installation docs explain how to install the theme using either of these methods.\nProject structure #In order to take advantage of the default configuration, your project should look something like this\u0026hellip;\n. ├── assets │ └── css │ └── compiled │ └── main.css # this is the file we will generate ├── config # site config │ └── _default ├── content # site content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── projects │ │ └── _index.md │ └── blog │ └── _index.md ├── layouts # custom layouts for your site │ ├── partials │ │ └── extend-article-link.html │ ├── projects │ │ └── list.html │ └── shortcodes │ └── disclaimer.html └── themes └── congo # git submodule or manual theme install This example structure adds a new projects content type with its own custom layout along with a custom shortcode and extended partial. Provided the project follows this structure, all that\u0026rsquo;s required is to recompile the main.css file.\nInstall dependencies #In order for this to work you\u0026rsquo;ll need to change into the themes/congo/ directory and install the project dependencies. You\u0026rsquo;ll need npm on your local machine for this step.\ncd themes/congo npm install Run the Tailwind compiler #With the dependencies installed all that\u0026rsquo;s left is to use Tailwind CLI to invoke the JIT compiler. Navigate back to the root of your Hugo project and issue the following command:\ncd ../.. ./themes/congo/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/congo/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/congo/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an ugly command due to the paths involved but essentially you\u0026rsquo;re calling Tailwind CLI and passing it the location of the Tailwind config file (the one we looked at above), where to find the theme\u0026rsquo;s main.css file and then where you want the compiled CSS file to be placed (it\u0026rsquo;s going into the assets/css/compiled/ folder of your Hugo project).\nThe config file will automatically inspect all the content and layouts in your project as well as all those in the theme and build a new CSS file that contains all the CSS required for your website. Due to the way Hugo handles file hierarchy, this file in your project will now automatically override the one that comes with the theme.\nEach time you make a change to your layouts and need new Tailwind CSS styles, you can simply re-run the command and generate the new CSS file. You can also add -w to the end of the command to run the JIT compiler in watch mode.\nMake a build script #To fully complete this solution, you can simplify this whole process by adding aliases for these commands, or do what I do and add a package.json to the root of your project which contains the necessary scripts\u0026hellip;\n// package.json { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-website\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;hugo server -b http://localhost -p 8000\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=development ./themes/congo/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/congo/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/congo/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit -w\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;build\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=production ./themes/congo/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/congo/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/congo/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit\u0026#34; }, // and more... } Now when you want to work on designing your site, you can invoke npm run dev and the compiler will run in watch mode. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to deploy, run npm run build and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a clean Tailwind CSS build.\n🙋‍♀️ If you need help, feel free to ask a question on GitHub Discussions.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/docs/advanced-customisation/","section":"Documentation","summary":"Congo supports advanced customisations that include modifying the underlying Tailwind configuration, building the theme manually and providing custom CSS.","title":"Advanced Customisation"},{"content":"There are many ways you can make advanced changes to Congo.

Only make customisations in your Hugo project\u0026rsquo;s sub-directories, not in the themes directory itself. Congo is built to take advantage of all the standard Hugo practices. It is designed to allow all aspects of the theme to be customised and overridden without changing any of the core theme files. This allows for a seamless upgrade experience while giving you total control over the look and feel of your website.\nIn order to achieve this, you should never manually adjust any of the theme files directly. Whether you install using Hugo modules, as a git submodule or manually include the theme in your themes/ directory, you should always leave these files intact.\nThe correct way to adjust any theme behaviour is by overriding files using Hugo\u0026rsquo;s powerful file lookup order. In summary, the lookup order ensures any files you include in your project directory will automatically take precedence over any theme files.\nFor example, if you wanted to override the main article template in Congo, you can simply create your own layouts/_default/single.html file and place it in the root of your project. This file will then override the single.html from the theme without ever changing the theme itself. This works for any theme files - HTML templates, partials, shortcodes, config files, data, assets, etc.\nAs long as you follow this simple practice, you will always be able to update the theme (or test different theme versions) without worrying that you will lose any of your custom changes.\nColour schemes #Congo ships with a number of colour schemes out of the box. To change the basic colour scheme, you can set the colorScheme theme parameter. Refer to the Getting Started section to learn more about the built-in schemes.\nIn addition to the default schemes, you can also create your own and re-style the entire website to your liking. Schemes are created by by placing a \u0026lt;scheme-name\u0026gt;.css file in the assets/css/schemes/ folder. Once the file is created, simply refer to it by name in the theme configuration.\nCongo defines a three-colour palette that is used throughout the theme. The three colours are defined as neutral, primary and secondary variants, each containing ten shades of colour.\nDue to the way Tailwind CSS 3.0 calculates colour values with opacity, the colours specified in the scheme need to conform to a particular format by providing the red, green and blue colour values.\n:root { --color-primary-500: 139, 92, 246; } This example defines a CSS variable for the primary-500 colour with a red value of 139, green value of 92 and blue value of 246.\nUse one of the existing theme stylesheets as a template. You are free to define your own colours, but for some inspiration, check out the official Tailwind colour palette reference.\nOverriding the stylesheet #Sometimes you need to add a custom style to style your own HTML elements. Congo provides for this scenario by allowing you to override the default styles in your own CSS stylesheet. Simply create a custom.css file in your project\u0026rsquo;s assets/css/ folder.\nThe custom.css file will be minified by Hugo and loaded automatically after all the other theme styles which means anything in your custom file will take precedence over the defaults.\nAdjusting the font size #Changing the font size of your website is one example of overriding the default stylesheet. Congo makes this simple as it uses scaled font sizes throughout the theme which are derived from the base HTML font size. By default, Tailwind sets the default size to 12pt, but it can be changed to whatever value you prefer.\nCreate a custom.css file using the instructions above and add the following CSS declaration:\n/* Increase the default font size */ html { font-size: 13pt; } Simply by changing this one value, all the font sizes on your website will be adjusted to match this new size. Therefore, to increase the overall font sizes used, make the value greater than 12pt. Similarly, to decrease the font sizes, make the value less than 12pt.\nBuilding the theme CSS from source #If you\u0026rsquo;d like to make a major change, you can take advantage of Tailwind CSS\u0026rsquo;s JIT compiler and rebuild the entire theme CSS from scratch. This is useful if you want to adjust the Tailwind configuration or add extra Tailwind classes to the main stylesheet.\nNote: Building the theme manually is intended for advanced users. Let\u0026rsquo;s step through how building the Tailwind CSS works.\nTailwind configuration #In order to generate a CSS file that only contains the Tailwind classes that are actually being used the JIT compiler needs to scan through all the HTML templates and Markdown content files to check which styles are present in the markup. The compiler does this by looking at the tailwind.config.js file which is included in the root of the theme directory:\n// themes/congo/tailwind.config.js module.exports = { content: [ \u0026#34;./layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/congo/layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/congo/content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, ], // and more... }; This default configuration has been included with these content paths so that you can easily generate your own CSS file without needing to modify it, provided you follow a particular project structure. Namely, you have to include Congo in your project as a subdirectory at themes/congo/. This means you cannot easily use Hugo Modules to install the theme and you must go down either the git submodule (recommended) or manual install routes. The Installation docs explain how to install the theme using either of these methods.\nProject structure #In order to take advantage of the default configuration, your project should look something like this\u0026hellip;\n. ├── assets │ └── css │ └── compiled │ └── main.css # this is the file we will generate ├── config # site config │ └── _default ├── content # site content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── projects │ │ └── _index.md │ └── blog │ └── _index.md ├── layouts # custom layouts for your site │ ├── partials │ │ └── extend-article-link.html │ ├── projects │ │ └── list.html │ └── shortcodes │ └── disclaimer.html └── themes └── congo # git submodule or manual theme install This example structure adds a new projects content type with its own custom layout along with a custom shortcode and extended partial. Provided the project follows this structure, all that\u0026rsquo;s required is to recompile the main.css file.\nInstall dependencies #In order for this to work you\u0026rsquo;ll need to change into the themes/congo/ directory and install the project dependencies. You\u0026rsquo;ll need npm on your local machine for this step.\ncd themes/congo npm install Run the Tailwind compiler #With the dependencies installed all that\u0026rsquo;s left is to use Tailwind CLI to invoke the JIT compiler. Navigate back to the root of your Hugo project and issue the following command:\ncd ../.. ./themes/congo/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/congo/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/congo/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an ugly command due to the paths involved but essentially you\u0026rsquo;re calling Tailwind CLI and passing it the location of the Tailwind config file (the one we looked at above), where to find the theme\u0026rsquo;s main.css file and then where you want the compiled CSS file to be placed (it\u0026rsquo;s going into the assets/css/compiled/ folder of your Hugo project).\nThe config file will automatically inspect all the content and layouts in your project as well as all those in the theme and build a new CSS file that contains all the CSS required for your website. Due to the way Hugo handles file hierarchy, this file in your project will now automatically override the one that comes with the theme.\nEach time you make a change to your layouts and need new Tailwind CSS styles, you can simply re-run the command and generate the new CSS file. You can also add -w to the end of the command to run the JIT compiler in watch mode.\nMake a build script #To fully complete this solution, you can simplify this whole process by adding aliases for these commands, or do what I do and add a package.json to the root of your project which contains the necessary scripts\u0026hellip;\n// package.json { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-website\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;hugo server -b http://localhost -p 8000\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=development ./themes/congo/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/congo/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/congo/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit -w\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;build\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=production ./themes/congo/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/congo/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/congo/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit\u0026#34; }, // and more... } Now when you want to work on designing your site, you can invoke npm run dev and the compiler will run in watch mode. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to deploy, run npm run build and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a clean Tailwind CSS build.\n🙋‍♀️ If you need help, feel free to ask a question on GitHub Discussions.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/advanced-customisation/","section":"Projects","summary":"Congo supports advanced customisations that include modifying the underlying Tailwind configuration, building the theme manually and providing custom CSS.","title":"Advanced Customisation"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/css/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Css"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/deployment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Deployment"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/github/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Github"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/hosting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hosting"},{"content":"There are many ways to deploy your Hugo website built with Congo.

Besides, it now supports special characters in post titles, ensuring accurate, flexible and eye-catching social media previews.\nSITE.ogImage is now optional. If it is not specified, AstroPaper will automatically generate an OG image using SITE.title, SITE.desc and SITE.website\nTheme meta tag #The theme-color meta tag has been added to dynamically adapt to theme switches, ensuring a seamless user experience.\nNotice the difference at the top\nAstroPaper v2 theme switch\nAstroPaper v3 theme switch\nOther Changes #Astro Prettier Plugin #Astro Prettier Plugin is installed out-of-the-box in order to keep the project tidy and organized.\nMinor Style Changes #The single-line code block wrapping issue has been solved, making your code snippets look pristine.\nUpdate nav style CSS to allow adding more nav links to the navigation.\nUpgrade to AstroPaper v3 # This section is only for those who want to upgrade AstroPaper v3 from the older versions.\nThis section will help you migrate from AstroPaper v2 to AstroPaper v3.\nBefore reading the rest of the section, you might also want to check this article for upgrading dependencies and AstroPaper.\nOption 1: Fresh Restart (recommended) #In this release, a lot of changes have been made_ replacing old Astro APIs with newer APIs, bug fixes, new features etc. Thus, if you are someone who didn\u0026rsquo;t make customization very much, you should follow this approach.\nStep 1: Keep all your updated files\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to keep all the files which have been already updated. These files include\n/src/config.ts (didn\u0026rsquo;t touch in v3) /src/styles/base.css (minor changes in v3; mentioned below) /src/assets/ (didn\u0026rsquo;t touch in v3) /public/assets/ (didn\u0026rsquo;t touch in v3) /content/blog/ (it\u0026rsquo;s your blog content directory 🤷🏻‍♂️) Any other customizations you\u0026rsquo;ve made. /* file: /src/styles/base.css */ @layer base { /* Other Codes */ ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover { @apply bg-skin-card-muted; } /* Old code code { white-space: pre; overflow: scroll; } */ /* New code */ code, blockquote { word-wrap: break-word; } pre \u0026gt; code { white-space: pre; } } @layer components { /* other codes */ } Step 1: Replace everything else with AstroPaper v3\nIn this step, replace everything_ except above files/directories (plus your customized files/directories)_ with AstroPaper v3.\nStep 3: Schema Updates\nKeep in mind that /src/content/_schemas.ts has been replaced with /src/content/config.ts.\nBesides, there is no longer BlogFrontmatter type exported from /src/content/config.ts.\nTherefore, all the BlogFrontmatter type inside files need to be updated with CollectionEntry\u0026lt;\u0026quot;blog\u0026quot;\u0026gt;[\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;].\nFor example: src/components/Card.tsx\n// AstroPaper v2 import type { BlogFrontmatter } from \u0026#34;@content/_schemas\u0026#34;; export interface Props { href?: string; frontmatter: BlogFrontmatter; secHeading?: boolean; } // AstroPaper v3 import type { CollectionEntry } from \u0026#34;astro:content\u0026#34;; export interface Props { href?: string; frontmatter: CollectionEntry\u0026lt;\u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;\u0026gt;[\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;]; secHeading?: boolean; } Option 2: Upgrade using Git #This approach is not recommended for most users. You should do the \u0026ldquo;Option 1\u0026rdquo; if you can. Only do this if you know how to resolve merge conflicts and you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nActually, I\u0026rsquo;ve already written a blog post for this case and you can check out here.\nOutro #Ready to explore the exciting new features and improvements in AstroPaper v3?

Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too.\nApart from macroprudential tool central banks has another powerful tool: communication. Communication has become as important financial monitoring and management to effective central bank operations. If done well, communication can strengthen understanding of central bank objectives by market agent as well as public, help shape the market mood and provide reassurance in times of stress.\nIn this project, we are going to check and rank the communication channel and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective communication can help to shape the view of public and increase the policy effectiveness. In this regard, for example, the Guardian newspaper has recently changed their language on climate matters, and they no longer use \u0026ldquo;climate change\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;climate crisis” since it is a crisis, not a change. In a similar manner, by using natural language processing method, we are going to rank the central bank according to their sensitivity of this issue.\nBrief Description of Work # Collection of texts from central bank publications globally. Data cleaning and processing for dataset preparation. Analysis of complex datasets with reporting software and Python. Data collection and cleaning responsibilities. Interpretation and analysis for clear data visualizations. Experience with NLP tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch is advantageous. Intended Learning Outcomes and Work Benefits # First-hand understanding of academic research conduction. Overview of macroeconomic research methods. Reinforcement of data process importance from collection to analysis. Rigorous practical experience in financial data techniques for academic publishing.

This course covers three significant areas: the evolving landscape of digital currencies like Bitcoin and their potential to redefine traditional monetary systems; the vital role of central banks in addressing the global climate crisis and maintaining financial stability; and the impact of big financial data, AI, machine learning, and algorithmic trading on financial markets. Each topic is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of current and emerging trends in finance and economics, equipping them with insights into the challenges and opportunities in today\u0026rsquo;s interconnected financial world.\nBitcoin, cryptocurrency, central bank digital currency: Will Bitcoin become the money of the future? #In each single day, people around the world make more than 2 billion digital payments. Each of these transactions rely on the monetary system – the set of institutions and arrangements that surround and support monetary exchange. In other words a centralised system. This centralised system with the central bank at its centre has served society well. Yet digital innovation is expanding the frontier of technological possibilities, placing new demands on the system. Many believe that Bitcoin will replace the dollar and will be the money of the future. We will try to answer this question by considering other cryptocurrency and financial technology by comparison todays financial markets.\nGlobal Climate Crises and Financial Stability #The era of one policy objective –inflation targeting– and one tool – interest rates – is over for the central banks for the sake of financial stability. Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too. In this theme, we are going to understand the channels and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective monetary policy (green central banking) can help to shape the works of financial market and increase the policy effectiveness.\nBig Financial Data, AI, Machine Learning and Algorithm Trade. #Big financial data refers to large, diverse and complex data sets that has a potential to provide solutions to long-standing business challenges. In other words, big data is completely revolutionising in many different areas for the financial world. In this course we are going to look at how financial institutions can use real time big data to improve the ability for dealing with fraudulent activities, or how the functioning of financial markets will be changed. For example, trade pattern in stock exchanges all around world are going to be affected by algorithm trade by utilising high frequency data.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/posts/finance21/","section":"Content Samples","summary":"I teach an engaging summer school course at the University of Warwick, specifically tailored for about 200 pre-university students from across the world.","title":"Finance in the 21st Century (including cryptocurrencies)"},{"content":"This module provides students who have a mathematical background with an introduction to macroeconomics.

Focusing on the financial system and monetary policy, this course looks at key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, banking, monetary policy and importantly their interaction and how this impacts the real world. The course will relate this to recent economic events which have reverberated worldwide. It is particularly suitable for students wishing to enter careers in financial markets or further study in this area.\nThe Money and Banking course will look at some key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, monetary policy and banking and how their interactions affect the real world.\nThe financial system has undergone many changes since the credit crunch and the Central Banks have had the unenviable task of stimulating the economy, encouraging lending, managing inflation and exchange rates. This course will focus on the financial system and monetary policy in countries around the world and present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations, evaluating their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis.\nCourse Outline #The focus of the course will be the theory and practice of monetary policy institutions. Within this, the interaction between the financial system (in terms of its institutions and instruments) and the macroeconomy will be examined and there will be a strong practical and policy related element to the course. The course will present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations and evaluate their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis. A broad range of topics will be analysed, including how bank runs develop and a discussion of the financial crises in the US and the Eurozone and their different experiences. The course will also introduce the students to some of the state of the art methods applied in modern macroeconomics such as the new Keynesian models. The following list includes the topics that will be covered:\nMoney supply and the role of the banking sector Interest rates and rates of return The stock market and financial market efficiency Monetary policy and monetary rules New Keynesian macroeconomic models Financial crises and regulation The 2008’s financial crisis and monetary policy responses Course Aims #This course aims to draw on recent financial events from across the world and provide students with a detailed understanding of the economic theory behind the way in which monetary policy can be designed and implemented. By focussing on the interactions between monetary policy, banking and financial markets, this course will give students the tools they need to understand and evaluate these links and apply their findings to real world applications in a variety of countries. Students taking this course will gain a greater awareness of the key elements of the financial system and the roles played by different financial assets. The course aims to give students greater awareness of the monetary transmission mechanism and how we can use modern empirical methods to understand it.\nThere are important economic lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis and this course will aim to relate relevant economic theory and applications to recent events which have reverberated worldwide. With the aim of developing students’ knowledge and understanding of the complex interactions between monetary policy, financial markets, banks and the economic situation, this course will be ideal for anyone looking to further their knowledge in monetary and financial economics, perhaps with an aim of pursuing a career in this field or undertaking postgraduate study. It will therefore aim to provide students with a rare opportunity to combine academic theory with their interest in a future career in such a direct manner.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this module, students should be able to:\nUnderstand the main elements of the financial system. Apply both micro and macro theory to real-world situations in the areas of money and banking. Outline and give a detailed justification of the main goals of monetary policy. Assess the relative merits of different countries’ monetary policy institutions. Critically discuss and debate a range of current monetary issues. Express their views about pertinent monetary and fiscal issues and evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams. Course Structure #For this course, there will be 4 hours of teaching on most weekdays, comprised of lectures and small group teaching. The structure will be:\n3 hours of lectures. A 1 hour seminar in small groups. Students will also be given time each day for independent study. Towards the end of the third week, students will also be provided with time for revision.\nDue to the intensive nature of the Warwick Summer School, students are expected to attend all timetabled teaching activity, to engage with the teaching material and to spend an average of 2-3 hours per day in self-guided study.\nStudents registered for Warwick Summer School must attain a minimum of 75% authorised attendance of the timetabled teaching activity. If students fall short of this threshold, they will not be awarded a certificate of completion and they will not be able to sit the exam/submit final assessment.\nAuthorised attendance includes any sickness absence during the course of the programme that has been properly notified and recorded. An attendance register will be taken at the beginning of teaching session so students need to ensure they arrive on time in order to be marked as attended.\nCourse Assessment The module will be assessed via a 2-hour examination. It should be noted that the exam is not compulsory. Everyone who completes the course – whether or not they sit the exam - will receive a certificate of attendance.\nStudents who choose to sit the final exam will receive a transcript of results. The transcript of results will state the name of the student, the course studied, the exam mark and the grade. Transcripts are automatically sent to students via email by the middle of September. You should keep this safe in case you need it for credit transfer approval or for future reference.

[Click to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OazQ0H7FAUk) Organisation #The course will be divided into two parts. The first part of the course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use mathematical tools and theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. The second part of the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy and global banking. We will analyze theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analyzing policy responses.\nApproach: #The course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. Furthermore, the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy. We will analyse various theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analysing policy responses.\nPrerequisites # An undergraduate-level understanding of economics/finance knowledge is assumed. Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is required. Class Policy # Regular attendance is essential and expected. Grading Policy: # The module is examined in a two and half hour written exam in May (80%) and one 1-hour end-of-term test (20%). The end-of-term test will be held on March 18th (Check the date and time again). End of term test will cover all topics covered in lectures from week 16 to 22. All topics covered up to week 24 (including) will be included in the final exam in May. Course Outline #Principal Aims: #The aim of the module is to equip students with a variety of theoretical and econometric tools and knowledge to study and understand key issues in global finance and to analyse policy responses. It departs from standard theoretical models of international finance and uses mathematical tools and econometric methods to build up from these models and to assess complex issues relating to the global finance. The first objective is to introduce a set of issues and questions that are central to modern finance and macroeconomics, and that are genuinely interesting, such as: To provide students with the opportunity to understand the core theoretical models used in international macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, and how to use them to enhance their comprehension of real-world macroeconomic experiences, especially involving macroeconomic and financial policy.\nPrincipal Learning Outcomes: #By the end of the module, the student should have the theoretical and empirical tools and knowledge to understand current academic and policy debates in international finance. In addition, it is expected that the student will have an understanding of a wide variety of theoretical models commonly used in global finance; an ability to present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams as appropriate; an understanding of the relationship between different models, and how to apply them in the analysis of recent global finance episodes and policy discussions affecting actual economies and business world.\nIntellectual and Practical Skills: # The ability to analyse facts and circumstances to determine the cause of a problem and identifying and selecting appropriate solutions. Conceptual and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Numeracy and quantitative skills to manipulate data, evaluate, estimate, and model business problems, functions, and phenomena. Required Readings: #There is no textbook for this course. The required readings consist of a collection of book chapters, journal articles, and working papers. Note that these readings may be subject to change. I will post the required readings before each class on the course website. The reading list includes many non-required readings. These are intended for those students that would like to deepen their understanding of a topic, particularly those that may be interested in working on the topic for their dissertation.\nMain References #The course is based on lecture notes/slides which will be posted in course page prior to the lectures. Participation in lectures together with studying the lecture notes, is sufficient to succeed on the course. The lecturer will make available all the slides used in lectures. There is no additional compulsory reading but here is the list of various interesting and useful books that will be touched during the course. In addition to book a number of journal articles are assigned readings and will be made available through the course website.
