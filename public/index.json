While extensive literature documents heterogeneous firm responses to monetary policy through traditional channels like size and leverage, whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics create distinct transmission mechanisms is unknown. Using high-frequency identification around 160 Federal Reserve announcements (2005-2025), we uncover an asymmetric pattern high-ESG firms gain 1.6 basis points protection from contractionary target surprises yet suffer 2.6 basis points greater sensitivity to forward guidance shocks. This asymmetry persists within industries and intensifies with investor climate awareness. Remarkably, the Paris Agreement inverted these relationships—before December 2015, high-ESG firms were more vulnerable to contractionary policy within industries; afterward, they gained protection, a 186 basis point reversal. We develop a two-period model featuring heterogeneous investors with sustainability preferences that quantitatively matches these patterns. The model reveals how ESG investors\u0026rsquo; non-pecuniary utility creates differential demand elasticities, simultaneously protecting green firms from immediate rate changes while amplifying forward guidance vulnerability through their longer investment horizons. These findings establish environmental characteristics as a new dimension of monetary policy non-neutrality, with profound implications as sustainable finance continues expanding..","title":"Green Shields: The Role of ESG in Uncertain Times"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/monetary-policy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Monetary Policy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/sustainable-finance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sustainable Finance"},{"content":"Congo has full support for Hugo taxonomies and will adapt to any taxonomy set up.

O gollerden biri malum, hakemi ve milyonları kandıran, kurnaz, kural dışı “Tanrı’nın Eli” golüydü. Diğeri ise Maradona’nın İngiliz savunmasını 60 metre boyunca peşinden sürüklediği ve beş altı şaşkın oyuncunun kendisini aldatmak için hamle yapmasını beklerken düz bir hat üzerinde ilerlediği muhteşem koşusuydu. Bu koşu sonrası attığı gol futbol tarihine 100 yılın golü efsanevi golü olarak geçti. Aslında Maradona aşağı yukarı düm düz koşmuştu ve fakat bu tahmin edilemezdi - tıpkı modern para politikaları gibi.\nVe son zamanlarda Türkiye’nin para politikalarına bakıldığında, bu Maradona büyüsünün bir yansımasını görmek zor değil: hatalar ve yanıltıcı adımların ardından disiplinli, stratejik bir sprint var gibi görünüyor. Yıllarca özellikle de Nureddin Nebati\u0026ndash;Şahap Kavcıoğlu döneminde Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası, ekonomik ortodoksluğun kurallarını esnetmeye çalışan, ne yapmak istediği nereye varmak istediği anlaşılmayan sıradışı bir yaklaşıma sıkıştı kaldı. Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan’ın yüksek faiz oranlarının enflasyona neden olduğuna (onu dizginleyeceğine değil) dair ısrarı, enflasyon hızla artarken agresif faiz indirimlerine yol açtı. Sonuç? Değer kaybeden lira, yükselen fiyatlar ve ekonomik kaos. Özetle, Türkiye’nin merkez bankası eliyle yürüttüğü ve milyonlarca insan üzerinde yaptığı deney başarısız oldu.\nBu dönem, Maradona’nın “Tanrı’nın Eli” oyununa benzetilebilir - cüretkar, alışılmadık ve riskli. Dünya, bu deneyi yani Türkiye’nin enflasyonunun neredeyse %100’e fırlamasını, tasarrufların erimesini ve günlük maliyetlerin neredeyse katlanılamaz hale gelmesini merakla seyretti. Bu yüksek riskli bir oyundu ve hakem - piyasa - aldatılmadı. Merkez bankasının kumarı krize doğru ilerledi ve hangi açıdan bakılırsa bakılsın krizin kötü sonuçlarını başta vatandaş olmak üzere tüm piyasa bunu tecrübe etti.\nAncak, tıpkı Maradona’nın ikinci golü gibi, Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası da farklı bir vitese geçmiş görünüyor. New York Fed eski ekonomisti ve yeni başkan Fatih Karahan yönetiminde, banka daha ortodoks yeni bakan Mehmet Şimşek’in tabiri ile \u0026lsquo;akılcı\u0026rsquo; bir yaklaşıma yöneldi. Kısa vadede acı çekmek pahasına faiz oranlarını artırdı. Maradona’nın beklentileri boşa çıkaran düz koşusu gibi, Türkiye şimdi piyasalara ekonomiyi istikrara kavuşturma konusunda ciddi olduğunu sinyallerle gösteren net ve istikrarlı bir yol izliyor. Eylül 2024’te, bir yılı aşkın süredir ilk kez enflasyon %50’nin altına düştü - bu yeni taktiklerin sonuç vermeye başladığının kanıtı.\nYeni Şafak gazetesinin merkez bankasına politikalarına dair manşetleri! Maradona Etkisi ve Modern Para Polikalar #Para politikası ile Maradona arasında yapılan bu benzetme, eski İngiltere Merkez Bankası Başkanı Mervyn King tarafından ortaya atılmıştı. King’in “Maradona Etkisi”, merkez bankalarının ekonomileri sürekli müdahale ile değil, beklentileri yöneterek nasıl etkileyebileceğini dile getirmek için ortaya atılmıştı. Maradona’nın düz koşusunun defansı zigzag yapacağını düşünmeye nasıl ittiyse, merkez bankaları da piyasaları büyük politika değişiklikleri yapmadan gelecek eylemleri konusunda ikna ederek istikrar sağlayabilir. Aksi halde Amerika merkez bankası eşki başkanı nobelli iktisatçı Ben Bernanke’nin dediği gibi merkez bankası \u0026lsquo;hall of mirrors\u0026rsquo; (birbirini tekrar eden aynalı salon) çıkmazına düşer ve bu kısır döngüden çıkmak yine ve daha acı reçeteler gerektirir.\nTürkiye için, merkez bankası şimdi benzer bir meydan okumayla karşı karşıya. Faiz oranlarını artırmaya odaklanmalarının başlangıçtaki tepkisi olumlu oldu; enflasyon düşmeye başladı ve lira toparlanma belirtileri gösteriyor. Ancak gerçek test, özellikle faiz oranlarını yeniden düşürme yönünde siyasi (bakınız yenişafak manşetleri gibi) baskılar altında bu momentumu sürdürebilmek olacaktır. Tıpkı Maradona’nın koşusu gibi, bu işin anahtarı doğru yolu izlemek, erken sağa sola sapma cazibesine kapılmamak ve piyasanın güvenini korumaktır.\nİnce Çizgide Yürümek: Futboldan Dersler #Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası hassas bir dengeyi korumak zorunda. Faiz oranlarını çok erken indirirse, önceki kontrolsüz enflasyonun tekrarı riski ortaya çıkacağı çok net. Maradona’nın savunmacılardan kaçınmak için düz bir hat üzerinde ilerlemek zorunda olması gibi; Türkiye’nin merkez bankacıları da gevşek politikalara yönelme çağrılarına kulak asmadan gözlerini fiyat istikrarı hedefinden ayırmamalıdır.\nMerkez bankacıların da söyleyeceği gibi, güvenilirlik her şeydir. Piyasalar bir merkez bankasının enflasyonla mücadelede kararlı olduğuna inandığında, agresif eylemler olmadan bile istikrar yaratabilir. Maradona Etkisi’nin özü budur: güvenilirlik yoluyla etki yaratmak. Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası, yatırımcıları ve vatandaşları enflasyonu dizginleme misyonunda kararlı olduğuna ikna edebilirse, sürekli faiz artışlarına duyulan ihtiyaç azalabilir.\nÖnümüzdeki Yol Haritası: Aynı Kararlılıkla Devam #Son gelişmeler Türkiye için daha iktisadi olarak parlak bir geleceğe işaret ediyor. Türk lirasına olan güven dikkatle yeniden inşa ediliyor, enflasyon soğuyor ve yatırımcılar biraz daha rahat nefes alıyor. Ancak bu geri dönüş hikayesini kalıcı bir hale getirmek için, Türkiye’nin merkez bankası tutarlı ve net olmalıdır. Maradona’nın, diğer herkesin kendisini sorgularken düz bir hat üzerinde koşması gibi, onların da stratejilerini sıkı tutmaları ve hedeflerine odaklanmaları gerekir.\nTürkiye’nin para politikası yolculuğu, net ve disiplinli politikanın gücünü - ve saptığında ortaya çıkan kaosu - çarpıcı bir şekilde hatırlatıyor. Merkez bankası, kendi “düz koşusunu” başarıyla yönetebilirse, uzun vadeli istikrar için bir gol atabilir. Beklentileri yönetme ve kesin eylemler karışımından oluşan Maradona Etkisi bir oyun planı sunuyor. Şimdi, Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası’nın bu planı uygulaması ve belki de Maradona gibi eleştirmenlerini şaşırtması gerekiyor.\n","date":"22 October 2024","permalink":"/blog/para-politikasinin-maradonasi/","section":"Blog|News","summary":"Yıllar süren alışılmadık politikaların yol açtığı ekonomik sıkıntıların ardından, Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası yeni yönetim altında disiplinli bir yaklaşım izliyor.

One was the infamous \u0026ldquo;Hand of God,\u0026rdquo; a cheeky, rule-bending act that somehow fooled the referee. The other was a masterpiece, as Maradona sliced through the English defense with a 60-meters sprint, straight as an arrow, gliding past five bewildered players who braced for feints that never came. His run was legendary, and his tactics were unpredictable—just like modern central banking.\nAnd when it comes to recent Turkish monetary policy, it’s hard not to see a reflection of this Maradona magic: a tale of missteps and misdirection, followed by a disciplined, strategic sprint. For years, Turkey’s central bank was locked in an unconventional approach—akin to Maradona’s first goal—trying to bend the rules of economic orthodoxy. President Erdoğan’s insistence that high interest rates cause inflation (rather than curb it) led to aggressive rate cuts even as inflation skyrocketed. The result? A plummeting lira, surging prices, and economic turmoil that left millions of Turkish citizens struggling to keep up.\nThis period resembled Maradona’s “Hand of God” play—audacious, unorthodox, and risky. The world watched as Turkey’s inflation soared close to 100%, with savings dwindling and everyday costs becoming almost unbearable. It was a high-stakes game, and the referee—the market—was not fooled. The central bank’s gambit seemed set to end in crisis.\nBut, just like Maradona’s second goal, Turkey’s central bank seems to have found a different gear. Under new governor Fatih Karahan, a former NY Fed economist, the bank has pivoted to a more orthodox approach. It has hiked interest rates, even if it means short-term pain. Much like Maradona\u0026rsquo;s straight run that defied expectations, Turkey is now taking a clear and steady course, signaling to the market that it is serious about stabilising the economy. In September 2024, inflation fell below 50% for the first time in over a year—proof that the new tactics are starting to bear fruit.\nThe Maradona Effect and Modern Monetary Playmaking #The analogy between Maradona and monetary policy was coined by Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England. King’s “Maradona Effect” explained how central banks can influence economies not by constant intervention but by managing expectations. Just as Maradona’s straight run tricked defenders into thinking he’d zigzag, central banks can stabilize markets by convincing them of a future course of action, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t make drastic policy shifts.\nFor Turkey, the central bank now faces a similar challenge. The initial response to their renewed focus on raising interest rates has been positive, with inflation starting to recede and the lira showing signs of recovery. But the real test will be whether they can sustain this momentum, especially under political pressure to cut rates again. Much like Maradona’s run, the key will be staying the course, resisting the temptation to jink left or right too soon, and maintaining the trust of the market.\nWalking the Fine Line: Lessons from the Field #Turkey’s central bank has a delicate balance to maintain. If it cuts rates too early, it risks a repeat of the previous runaway inflation. It’s like Maradona needing to stay in a straight line to avoid the defenders; Turkey’s central bankers need to keep their eyes on the goal—price stability—without getting sidetracked by calls for looser policies.\nCredibility, as any central banker would tell you, is everything. When markets believe that a central bank is committed to fighting inflation, it can create stability even without aggressive action. This is the essence of the Maradona Effect: influence through credibility. If Turkey’s central bank can convince investors and citizens that it is resolute in its mission to tame inflation, the need for continuous rate hikes may lessen.\nThe Road Ahead: Steady as She Goes #Recent developments hint at a brighter future. Confidence in the Turkish lira is cautiously rebuilding, inflation is cooling off, and investors are starting to breathe a little easier. But to make this comeback story a lasting one, Turkey\u0026rsquo;s central bank must remain consistent and clear. Like Maradona, who ran straight while everyone else second-guessed, they must keep their strategy tight and their goals in focus.\nTurkey’s monetary journey is a vivid reminder of the power of clear, disciplined policy—and the chaos that can arise when it strays. If the central bank can master its version of the “straight run,” it may just score a winning goal for long-term stability. The Maradona Effect, with its blend of expectation management and precise action, offers a playbook. Now, it’s up to Turkey’s central bank to follow through and, maybe, like Maradona, leave its critics stunned.\n","date":"21 October 2024","permalink":"/blog/turkish-central-bank-maradona-monetary-policy/","section":"Blog|News","summary":"Turkey’s central bank, after years of unconventional policy that led to economic turmoil, is now following a disciplined approach under new leadership.

Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too.\nApart from macroprudential tool central banks has another powerful tool: communication. Communication has become as important financial monitoring and management to effective central bank operations. If done well, communication can strengthen understanding of central bank objectives by market agent as well as public, help shape the market mood and provide reassurance in times of stress.\nIn this project, we are going to check and rank the communication channel and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective communication can help to shape the view of public and increase the policy effectiveness. In this regard, for example, the Guardian newspaper has recently changed their language on climate matters, and they no longer use \u0026ldquo;climate change\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;climate crisis” since it is a crisis, not a change. In a similar manner, by using natural language processing method, we are going to rank the central bank according to their sensitivity of this issue.\nBrief Description of Work # Collection of texts from central bank publications globally.

The end-of-term test will be held on March 18th (Check the date and time again). End of term test will cover all topics covered in lectures from week 16 to 22. All topics covered up to week 24 (including) will be included in the final exam in May. Course Outline #Principal Aims: #The aim of the module is to equip students with a variety of theoretical and econometric tools and knowledge to study and understand key issues in global finance and to analyse policy responses. It departs from standard theoretical models of international finance and uses mathematical tools and econometric methods to build up from these models and to assess complex issues relating to the global finance. The first objective is to introduce a set of issues and questions that are central to modern finance and macroeconomics, and that are genuinely interesting, such as: To provide students with the opportunity to understand the core theoretical models used in international macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, and how to use them to enhance their comprehension of real-world macroeconomic experiences, especially involving macroeconomic and financial policy.\nPrincipal Learning Outcomes: #By the end of the module, the student should have the theoretical and empirical tools and knowledge to understand current academic and policy debates in international finance. In addition, it is expected that the student will have an understanding of a wide variety of theoretical models commonly used in global finance; an ability to present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams as appropriate; an understanding of the relationship between different models, and how to apply them in the analysis of recent global finance episodes and policy discussions affecting actual economies and business world.\nIntellectual and Practical Skills: # The ability to analyse facts and circumstances to determine the cause of a problem and identifying and selecting appropriate solutions. Conceptual and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Numeracy and quantitative skills to manipulate data, evaluate, estimate, and model business problems, functions, and phenomena. Required Readings: #There is no textbook for this course. The required readings consist of a collection of book chapters, journal articles, and working papers. Note that these readings may be subject to change. I will post the required readings before each class on the course website. The reading list includes many non-required readings. These are intended for those students that would like to deepen their understanding of a topic, particularly those that may be interested in working on the topic for their dissertation.\nMain References #The course is based on lecture notes/slides which will be posted in course page prior to the lectures. Participation in lectures together with studying the lecture notes, is sufficient to succeed on the course. The lecturer will make available all the slides used in lectures.

Focusing on the financial system and monetary policy, this course looks at key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, banking, monetary policy and importantly their interaction and how this impacts the real world. The course will relate this to recent economic events which have reverberated worldwide. It is particularly suitable for students wishing to enter careers in financial markets or further study in this area.\nThe Money and Banking course will look at some key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, monetary policy and banking and how their interactions affect the real world.\nThe financial system has undergone many changes since the credit crunch and the Central Banks have had the unenviable task of stimulating the economy, encouraging lending, managing inflation and exchange rates. This course will focus on the financial system and monetary policy in countries around the world and present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations, evaluating their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis.\nCourse Outline #The focus of the course will be the theory and practice of monetary policy institutions. Within this, the interaction between the financial system (in terms of its institutions and instruments) and the macroeconomy will be examined and there will be a strong practical and policy related element to the course. The course will present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations and evaluate their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis. A broad range of topics will be analysed, including how bank runs develop and a discussion of the financial crises in the US and the Eurozone and their different experiences. The course will also introduce the students to some of the state of the art methods applied in modern macroeconomics such as the new Keynesian models. The following list includes the topics that will be covered:\nMoney supply and the role of the banking sector Interest rates and rates of return The stock market and financial market efficiency Monetary policy and monetary rules New Keynesian macroeconomic models Financial crises and regulation The 2008’s financial crisis and monetary policy responses Course Aims #This course aims to draw on recent financial events from across the world and provide students with a detailed understanding of the economic theory behind the way in which monetary policy can be designed and implemented. By focussing on the interactions between monetary policy, banking and financial markets, this course will give students the tools they need to understand and evaluate these links and apply their findings to real world applications in a variety of countries. Students taking this course will gain a greater awareness of the key elements of the financial system and the roles played by different financial assets. The course aims to give students greater awareness of the monetary transmission mechanism and how we can use modern empirical methods to understand it.\nThere are important economic lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis and this course will aim to relate relevant economic theory and applications to recent events which have reverberated worldwide. With the aim of developing students’ knowledge and understanding of the complex interactions between monetary policy, financial markets, banks and the economic situation, this course will be ideal for anyone looking to further their knowledge in monetary and financial economics, perhaps with an aim of pursuing a career in this field or undertaking postgraduate study. It will therefore aim to provide students with a rare opportunity to combine academic theory with their interest in a future career in such a direct manner.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this module, students should be able to:\nUnderstand the main elements of the financial system. Apply both micro and macro theory to real-world situations in the areas of money and banking. Outline and give a detailed justification of the main goals of monetary policy. Assess the relative merits of different countries’ monetary policy institutions. Critically discuss and debate a range of current monetary issues. Express their views about pertinent monetary and fiscal issues and evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams. Course Structure #For this course, there will be 4 hours of teaching on most weekdays, comprised of lectures and small group teaching. The structure will be:\n3 hours of lectures. A 1 hour seminar in small groups. Students will also be given time each day for independent study. Towards the end of the third week, students will also be provided with time for revision.\nDue to the intensive nature of the Warwick Summer School, students are expected to attend all timetabled teaching activity, to engage with the teaching material and to spend an average of 2-3 hours per day in self-guided study.\nStudents registered for Warwick Summer School must attain a minimum of 75% authorised attendance of the timetabled teaching activity. If students fall short of this threshold, they will not be awarded a certificate of completion and they will not be able to sit the exam/submit final assessment.\nAuthorised attendance includes any sickness absence during the course of the programme that has been properly notified and recorded. An attendance register will be taken at the beginning of teaching session so students need to ensure they arrive on time in order to be marked as attended.\nCourse Assessment The module will be assessed via a 2-hour examination. It should be noted that the exam is not compulsory. Everyone who completes the course – whether or not they sit the exam - will receive a certificate of attendance.\nStudents who choose to sit the final exam will receive a transcript of results. The transcript of results will state the name of the student, the course studied, the exam mark and the grade. Transcripts are automatically sent to students via email by the middle of September. You should keep this safe in case you need it for credit transfer approval or for future reference. If you would like us to email a copy of your transcript directly to someone at your University who deals with credit transfer please let us know.\nThe Summer School does not offer re-takes of examinations, whatever your result in the original examination.\nEntry Requirements #This course is open to students who are studying or have previously studied Economics at University level.

This course covers three significant areas: the evolving landscape of digital currencies like Bitcoin and their potential to redefine traditional monetary systems; the vital role of central banks in addressing the global climate crisis and maintaining financial stability; and the impact of big financial data, AI, machine learning, and algorithmic trading on financial markets. Each topic is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of current and emerging trends in finance and economics, equipping them with insights into the challenges and opportunities in today\u0026rsquo;s interconnected financial world.\nBitcoin, cryptocurrency, central bank digital currency: Will Bitcoin become the money of the future? #In each single day, people around the world make more than 2 billion digital payments. Each of these transactions rely on the monetary system – the set of institutions and arrangements that surround and support monetary exchange. In other words a centralised system. This centralised system with the central bank at its centre has served society well. Yet digital innovation is expanding the frontier of technological possibilities, placing new demands on the system. Many believe that Bitcoin will replace the dollar and will be the money of the future. We will try to answer this question by considering other cryptocurrency and financial technology by comparison todays financial markets.\nGlobal Climate Crises and Financial Stability #The era of one policy objective –inflation targeting– and one tool – interest rates – is over for the central banks for the sake of financial stability. Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too. In this theme, we are going to understand the channels and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective monetary policy (green central banking) can help to shape the works of financial market and increase the policy effectiveness.\nBig Financial Data, AI, Machine Learning and Algorithm Trade. #Big financial data refers to large, diverse and complex data sets that has a potential to provide solutions to long-standing business challenges. In other words, big data is completely revolutionising in many different areas for the financial world. In this course we are going to look at how financial institutions can use real time big data to improve the ability for dealing with fraudulent activities, or how the functioning of financial markets will be changed. For example, trade pattern in stock exchanges all around world are going to be affected by algorithm trade by utilising high frequency data.\n","date":"10 August 2023","permalink":"/blog/finance21/","section":"Blog|News","summary":"I teach an engaging summer school course at the University of Warwick, specifically tailored for about 200 pre-university students from across the world.

His passionate and straightforward approach in explaining intricate theories set a high standard for educational excellence. He embodied the essence of making learning enjoyable and accessible, an ethos I strive to emulate in my own teaching. His unique method of fostering curiosity and critical thinking among students, often referred to as the Feynman Technique has been a guiding principle in my journey as an educator. In every course I teach, I aim to channel his enthusiasm for discovery and clarity, ensuring that my students not only grasp the theoretical aspects of Finance and Economics but also appreciate their practical applications in the real world.\n","date":"16 August 2020","permalink":"/teaching/","section":"fatih.ai","summary":"Learn how to get up and running using Hugo and Congo from a completely blank state.

Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too.\nApart from macroprudential tool central banks has another powerful tool: communication. Communication has become as important financial monitoring and management to effective central bank operations. If done well, communication can strengthen understanding of central bank objectives by market agent as well as public, help shape the market mood and provide reassurance in times of stress.\nIn this project, we are going to check and rank the communication channel and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective communication can help to shape the view of public and increase the policy effectiveness. In this regard, for example, the Guardian newspaper has recently changed their language on climate matters, and they no longer use \u0026ldquo;climate change\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;climate crisis” since it is a crisis, not a change. In a similar manner, by using natural language processing method, we are going to rank the central bank according to their sensitivity of this issue.\nBrief Description of Work # Collection of texts from central bank publications globally. Data cleaning and processing for dataset preparation. Analysis of complex datasets with reporting software and Python. Data collection and cleaning responsibilities. Interpretation and analysis for clear data visualizations. Experience with NLP tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch is advantageous.

This course covers three significant areas: the evolving landscape of digital currencies like Bitcoin and their potential to redefine traditional monetary systems; the vital role of central banks in addressing the global climate crisis and maintaining financial stability; and the impact of big financial data, AI, machine learning, and algorithmic trading on financial markets. Each topic is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of current and emerging trends in finance and economics, equipping them with insights into the challenges and opportunities in today\u0026rsquo;s interconnected financial world.\nBitcoin, cryptocurrency, central bank digital currency: Will Bitcoin become the money of the future? #In each single day, people around the world make more than 2 billion digital payments. Each of these transactions rely on the monetary system – the set of institutions and arrangements that surround and support monetary exchange. In other words a centralised system. This centralised system with the central bank at its centre has served society well. Yet digital innovation is expanding the frontier of technological possibilities, placing new demands on the system. Many believe that Bitcoin will replace the dollar and will be the money of the future. We will try to answer this question by considering other cryptocurrency and financial technology by comparison todays financial markets.\nGlobal Climate Crises and Financial Stability #The era of one policy objective –inflation targeting– and one tool – interest rates – is over for the central banks for the sake of financial stability. Today, there are many challenges that central banks have to face and climate crisis is at the top of the list. To deliver financial stability in a world that is now so financially interconnected poses fresh challenges such as climate risk and recent pandemic which affects the two policy goals pursued by central banks, financial and monetary stability. Central banks need to not just adapt to changing conditions but equip new tools too. In this theme, we are going to understand the channels and efficiency of central banks climate change policy over the world. Since, an effective monetary policy (green central banking) can help to shape the works of financial market and increase the policy effectiveness.\nBig Financial Data, AI, Machine Learning and Algorithm Trade. #Big financial data refers to large, diverse and complex data sets that has a potential to provide solutions to long-standing business challenges. In other words, big data is completely revolutionising in many different areas for the financial world. In this course we are going to look at how financial institutions can use real time big data to improve the ability for dealing with fraudulent activities, or how the functioning of financial markets will be changed. For example, trade pattern in stock exchanges all around world are going to be affected by algorithm trade by utilising high frequency data.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/posts/finance21/","section":"Content Samples","summary":"","title":"Finance in the 21st Century (including cryptocurrencies)"},{"content":"This module provides students who have a mathematical background with an introduction to macroeconomics.

Focusing on the financial system and monetary policy, this course looks at key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, banking, monetary policy and importantly their interaction and how this impacts the real world. The course will relate this to recent economic events which have reverberated worldwide. It is particularly suitable for students wishing to enter careers in financial markets or further study in this area.\nThe Money and Banking course will look at some key issues in the theory and practice of financial markets, monetary policy and banking and how their interactions affect the real world.\nThe financial system has undergone many changes since the credit crunch and the Central Banks have had the unenviable task of stimulating the economy, encouraging lending, managing inflation and exchange rates. This course will focus on the financial system and monetary policy in countries around the world and present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations, evaluating their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis.\nCourse Outline #The focus of the course will be the theory and practice of monetary policy institutions. Within this, the interaction between the financial system (in terms of its institutions and instruments) and the macroeconomy will be examined and there will be a strong practical and policy related element to the course. The course will present an opportunity to discuss the financial institutions and monetary policies of different nations and evaluate their relative success in recovering from the financial crisis. A broad range of topics will be analysed, including how bank runs develop and a discussion of the financial crises in the US and the Eurozone and their different experiences. The course will also introduce the students to some of the state of the art methods applied in modern macroeconomics such as the new Keynesian models. The following list includes the topics that will be covered:\nMoney supply and the role of the banking sector Interest rates and rates of return The stock market and financial market efficiency Monetary policy and monetary rules New Keynesian macroeconomic models Financial crises and regulation The 2008’s financial crisis and monetary policy responses Course Aims #This course aims to draw on recent financial events from across the world and provide students with a detailed understanding of the economic theory behind the way in which monetary policy can be designed and implemented. By focussing on the interactions between monetary policy, banking and financial markets, this course will give students the tools they need to understand and evaluate these links and apply their findings to real world applications in a variety of countries. Students taking this course will gain a greater awareness of the key elements of the financial system and the roles played by different financial assets. The course aims to give students greater awareness of the monetary transmission mechanism and how we can use modern empirical methods to understand it.\nThere are important economic lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis and this course will aim to relate relevant economic theory and applications to recent events which have reverberated worldwide. With the aim of developing students’ knowledge and understanding of the complex interactions between monetary policy, financial markets, banks and the economic situation, this course will be ideal for anyone looking to further their knowledge in monetary and financial economics, perhaps with an aim of pursuing a career in this field or undertaking postgraduate study. It will therefore aim to provide students with a rare opportunity to combine academic theory with their interest in a future career in such a direct manner.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this module, students should be able to:\nUnderstand the main elements of the financial system. Apply both micro and macro theory to real-world situations in the areas of money and banking. Outline and give a detailed justification of the main goals of monetary policy. Assess the relative merits of different countries’ monetary policy institutions. Critically discuss and debate a range of current monetary issues. Express their views about pertinent monetary and fiscal issues and evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams. Course Structure #For this course, there will be 4 hours of teaching on most weekdays, comprised of lectures and small group teaching. The structure will be:\n3 hours of lectures. A 1 hour seminar in small groups. Students will also be given time each day for independent study. Towards the end of the third week, students will also be provided with time for revision.\nDue to the intensive nature of the Warwick Summer School, students are expected to attend all timetabled teaching activity, to engage with the teaching material and to spend an average of 2-3 hours per day in self-guided study.\nStudents registered for Warwick Summer School must attain a minimum of 75% authorised attendance of the timetabled teaching activity.

[Click to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OazQ0H7FAUk) Organisation #The course will be divided into two parts. The first part of the course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use mathematical tools and theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. The second part of the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy and global banking. We will analyze theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analyzing policy responses.\nApproach: #The course will focus on the effects of financial integration and the international transmission of shocks. We will use theoretical models to understand some major policy debates in international finance, including the determinants and consequences of global imbalances. Furthermore, the course examines the causes and consequences of financial crises, with a focus towards understanding current events in the global economy. We will analyse various theories of financial crises, with the objective of understanding the causes of crises and analysing policy responses.\nPrerequisites # An undergraduate-level understanding of economics/finance knowledge is assumed. Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is required. Class Policy # Regular attendance is essential and expected. Grading Policy: # The module is examined in a two and half hour written exam in May (80%) and one 1-hour end-of-term test (20%). The end-of-term test will be held on March 18th (Check the date and time again). End of term test will cover all topics covered in lectures from week 16 to 22. All topics covered up to week 24 (including) will be included in the final exam in May. Course Outline #Principal Aims: #The aim of the module is to equip students with a variety of theoretical and econometric tools and knowledge to study and understand key issues in global finance and to analyse policy responses. It departs from standard theoretical models of international finance and uses mathematical tools and econometric methods to build up from these models and to assess complex issues relating to the global finance. The first objective is to introduce a set of issues and questions that are central to modern finance and macroeconomics, and that are genuinely interesting, such as: To provide students with the opportunity to understand the core theoretical models used in international macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, and how to use them to enhance their comprehension of real-world macroeconomic experiences, especially involving macroeconomic and financial policy.\nPrincipal Learning Outcomes: #By the end of the module, the student should have the theoretical and empirical tools and knowledge to understand current academic and policy debates in international finance. In addition, it is expected that the student will have an understanding of a wide variety of theoretical models commonly used in global finance; an ability to present clearly and methodically in their own words, also using equations and diagrams as appropriate; an understanding of the relationship between different models, and how to apply them in the analysis of recent global finance episodes and policy discussions affecting actual economies and business world.\nIntellectual and Practical Skills: # The ability to analyse facts and circumstances to determine the cause of a problem and identifying and selecting appropriate solutions. Conceptual and critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Numeracy and quantitative skills to manipulate data, evaluate, estimate, and model business problems, functions, and phenomena. Required Readings: #There is no textbook for this course. The required readings consist of a collection of book chapters, journal articles, and working papers. Note that these readings may be subject to change. I will post the required readings before each class on the course website. The reading list includes many non-required readings. These are intended for those students that would like to deepen their understanding of a topic, particularly those that may be interested in working on the topic for their dissertation.\nMain References #The course is based on lecture notes/slides which will be posted in course page prior to the lectures. Participation in lectures together with studying the lecture notes, is sufficient to succeed on the course. The lecturer will make available all the slides used in lectures. There is no additional compulsory reading but here is the list of various interesting and useful books that will be touched during the course.
